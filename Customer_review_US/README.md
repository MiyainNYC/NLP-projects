# Market Research about a new product(light mask) coming into US market.

** One encouraging outcome after analysis is that topic modeling successfully help detect and filer ads. Since our clients form little interest, if any, on commericals ads, compared to organic customer conversation, this result could be seen as a big forward step in approaching a clean and effective dataset.
