GlyDerm Face Lotion Lite Review

Two of my favorite GlyDerm products!

Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid that the should be in your anti-aging arsenal.

It has the smallest molecules of all the alpha hydroxy acids, meaning it can penetrate the skin deeply and easily. 
In turn, it's an effective way to treat fine lines, acne, blackheads, dull skin and more.

I love GlyDerm's suite of products featuring glycolic acid, particularly their Face Lotion Lite, which I wear under my sunscreen or tinted moisturizer during the day or under my Hydrotone Lite face cream at night.

A E Skin Soft and Smooth Rejuvenation Demonstration 04

The A E Skin Soft and Smooth Rejuvenation treatment is a two-step procedure designed by Dr. Alex to address color and texture in a single session.

The first step is a Forever Young BBL IPL photofacial treatment. This step uses bright light to target dark spots and blood in the skin. This works well for sun damage, age spots, broken capillaries, and generalized redness.

The second step is a Micro Laser Peel. This step uses a different laser to remove a thin layer of dead skin cells from the surface. This exfoliates the skin to improve the texture. It also enhances the results of the first step by allowing the pigment to exfoliate faster. It also works well to address acne because it removes the dead skin cells which clog pores.

"Talking away the winter blues

Posted by Brenda Miao '19 / In Biological Sciences, Fall 2015, News / November 17, 2015

Over 14 million people in the United States alone suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a psychological mood disorder characterized by depression recurrent during a specific season, primarily winter.

While most people enjoy the cheerful ?holidays season,? others may find the idea of winter less appealing. 
Over 14 million people in the United States [[[APA format]]] alone suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a psychological mood disorder characterized by depression that recurs during a specific season, primarily winter. 
SAD accounts for approximately 15 % of all cases of recurrent depression. 
Conventional light therapy, which involves daily exposure to light boxes, has been proven effective in acutely treating SAD induced depression (1). 
However, a new, long-term study led by University of Vermont professor Kelly Rohan indicates that cognitive-behavioral therapy is more effective than conventional light therapy both in preventing the recurrence of SAD and reducing the severity of symptoms over long periods of time (2).

The researchers conducted this two-year study with 177 subjects that exhibited severe, SAD-associated depression. 
Participants in received either 6 weeks of light therapy, which consisted of a 30-minute exposure to bright, artificial lights every morning or 6 weeks of SAD-targeted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions twice a week (1). 
During the CBT sessions, the subjects learned skills helping them to cope with negative feelings or exhibit positive behaviors, such as actively seeking social interactions. 
Researchers then followed up and assessed the prevalence of seasonal depression in participants of both groups over a period of two years (2). 
Interestingly, during the study, the researchers also encouraged participants of light therapy to continue using their light boxes the following year, but only 11% did (1).

Results showed that the two groups experienced similar relief from SAD-related symptoms during the 6-week period, reaffirming light therapy as an effective short-term treatment for SAD. 
However, CBT participants were much less likely to experience the recurrence of depression and displayed significantly less severe symptoms during the following two years. 
These results, along with the prevalence of SAD and the inconvenience of daily light therapy over long periods of time, suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy is a more effective and sustainable long-term treatment than conventional light therapy (1).

"The Department of Pediatric Dermatology at Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo recently announced expanded hours for those who receive phototherapy treatments.

Phototherapy is a state-of-the-art ultraviolet light therapy used to treat a wide variety of skin disorders including eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo, pityriasis rosea, and many others. 
The pediatric dermatology department uses narrow-band ultraviolet B, considered the safest ultraviolet treatment.

Treatments are brief, painless and typically recommended two to three times a week, which is why hours were expanded.

"A clear complexion is something many people want, photorejuvenation which uses IPL (Intense Pulse Light) technology, can help reduce the appearance of some of the most common skin woes, including brown spots, melasma, broken capilaries & sun spots. This minimally invasive skin procedure can also treat signs of aging such as wrinkles or age spots. This also has very little recovery time and few side effects.

"Scientists put final pieces into place for seeing cancer with protons

New Delhi, Dec 3 (ANI): Scientists are currently putting together a unique medical imaging platform that could improve treatment for millions of cancer sufferers by making proton therapy a viable option.

Members of the multi-national research team behind the PRaVDA (Proton Radiotherapy Verification and Dosimetry Applications) project, led by the University of Lincoln, UK, are now building the instrument that will produce for the first time detailed three-dimensional images of a patient's anatomy using protons rather than x-rays.

To produce these Proton CT images, the world-first technology will use the same high energy particles that are used to destroy a tumour during proton therapy treatment.

Like x-rays, protons can penetrate tissue to reach deep tumours. 
However, compared to x-rays, protons cause less damage to healthy tissue in front of the tumour, and no damage at all to healthy tissue lying behind, which greatly reduces the side effects of radiation therapy.

Led by Nigel Allinson from the University of Lincoln, the PRaVDA team aims to become the first in the world to produce clinical-quality Proton CT imagery. 
They are currently working near Cape Town at the South African National Cyclotron - a type of particle accelerator.

Allinson said: ""Proton therapy is an improved approach for treating challenging tumours especially in the head and neck, and near critical organs. 
It is likely to become the preferred radiotherapy method for most childhood cancers, as the unwanted exposure to radiation of healthy tissue is much reduced and so the risk of second cancers later in life is also much reduced.

He added that having the ability to administer a high dose in a small region is the main underlying advantage of proton therapy, however accurate planning is absolutely essential to ensure that the dose does not miss the target tumour.

The PRaVDA researchers believe that Proton CT will soon be used as part of the planning process for cancer patients, as well as during and after treatment.

Proton therapy is rapidly gaining momentum as a cancer treatment around the world. 
The NHS will open two proton therapy centres in 2018 and up to another four private centres are also planned for the UK. (ANI)

"Carboxy For Stretch Marks

Stretch marks or striae are a common problem that affecting many men, women and teenagers. 
They frequently appear as unattractive red, purple or white streaks across the hips, stomach, breasts, buttocks, flanks, thighs, arms, or shoulders. 
They may occur with pregnancy, rapid growth spurts, weight lifting, rapid weight gain or loss, and medical steroid use. 
Stretch marks happen when the tissue under the skin is pulled by rapid growth or stretching. 
Although the skin is usually fairly elastic, when it?s overstretched, the normal production of collagen is disrupted. 
As a result, scars in the dermis called stretch marks may form.

At first, stretch marks may show up as reddish or purplish lines that may appear indented and have a different texture from the surrounding skin. 
Fortunately, stretch marks often turn lighter and almost disappear over time. 
Some have more severe stretch marks that result in permanent scars.

Laser or pulsed light therapy may help the redness. 
Resurfacing lasers remove the upper layers of the skin to improve the appearance. 
Microdermabrasion may be helpful but requires very many treatments for a mild to moderate improvement.

When carbon dioxide is injected superficially into the stretch marks it subscises the tissue so that adherent layers are separated. 
The skin repairs itself so that the stretch mark contracts and gradually becomes much smaller and less visible. 
Usually multiple treatments give the best results but the response varies for each person. 
We have seen moderate stretch marks almost disappear in one treatment but most require a series of several treatments. 
Combined treatments involving carboxytherapy, lasers and skin care products sometimes produce faster results.

""I have been getting my hair treated at

this center for almost 3 months now and

am amazed at the results I've been seeing.

When I first came in, I didn't think my hair

would grow back, but now I am seeing

drastic changes that I would've never

believed. 
My hair is falling out less and is

becoming stronger than it was at first.

The hair at the top of my head that I

thought would never come back, is coming

back at a faster rate than expected and I

couldn't be happier.""

""When you look good, you feel good and when you

feel good only positive things can happen.

Different people value different things.

Personally I feel that a Micron has helped me restore and maintain that

full head of hair. 
Their liquid treatments address

topical scalp issues which allows for positive growth

to occur again. 
These treatments in combination

with micron's hair restoration laser is the perfect

formula for restoring and maintaining that full head

of hair.

They customized a program to address my hair loss at a reasonable price,while

working around my schedule.""

"As they say in Game of Thrones , winter is coming. 
For kids, it?s time to build snowmen, play in the snow, and enjoy time away from school. 
But for many adults, winter is the gloomiest time of the year, not because of the cold weather per se, but because of a condition called seasonal affective disorder, also known by its apt acronym SAD. 
This condition affects over 14 million Americans, including 1.5 percent of the population in sunnier Southern states like Florida, but not surprisingly, close to 10 percent in the frigid north. 
A new study published this week in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy may actually be more effective than conventional light therapy when it comes to combating seasonal affective disorder. 
A group of 177 participants took part in a study led by the University of Vermont?s Prof. Kelly Rohan, whose team then had the group undergo light therapy for 30 minutes each morning for six weeks. 
This duration was tweaked over the coming weeks to reduce side effects and improve response among the subjects.

After this, some of the participants were asked to continue daily light exposure at home through the spring, and were given light box access the following winter. 
Another group of participants got special cognitive behavior therapy twice a week and 50 minutes a session over a six-week span. 
The CBT sessions made use of tools to help the subjects counter negative thoughts about the winter and avoid social isolation and other behaviors that darken one?s mood.

One winter after the initial treatment, both the light treatment and CBT groups reported similar relief from seasonal affective depression. 
Both treatments were proven to be effective in reducing SAD?s depressive symptoms. 
But by the second winter, over two-thirds of the light therapy group had quit the treatment. 
Depression was found to have recurred in 46 percent of those in the light therapy group, as compared to 27 percent in the CBT group. 
Further, depressive symptoms were more pronounced in the light treatment group.

?Light therapy is a palliative treatment, like blood pressure medication, that requires you to keep using the treatment for it to be effective,? said Prof. Rohan in a statement. 
?Adhering to the light therapy prescription upon waking for 30-60 minutes a day for up to five months in dark states can be burdensome.? 
She added that CBT is more recommendable against seasonal affective disorder as it?s a preventative treatment with a more long-lasting impact and greater control over depressive symptoms.

"Very good observations, Generally speaking the skin synthesizes Vitamin D by first absorbing sunlight.

In those countries that have less sunshine more Vitamin D is needed whether via food or supplements. 
Photo-therapy or light therapy is also used in extreme cases

Suicide rates are known to be highest in winter months and there are several studies that show the correlation between lack of sunshine/ vitamin d levels and depression.

Magnesium is indeed everyone's friend. 
The most recent big thing is it's ability to help with allergies"

Certified nutritionist Mike Walden would definitely write the acne an individual. 
The Acne treatment industry is full of high budget marketing with little regard for the reality. 
Walden's program is an omission. 
His methods are scientifically accurate and clinically seen to work.

Don't search around for products just and yet. 
Instead, start looking for individual what have been demonstrated to address the major reasons of wrinkles most practically. 
A product can just as good as elements it features.

The total body enhancement is an exercise and toning system that uses red light therapy and a vibrating plate for a variety of uses such as, skin firmness, improving muscle tone over time and relaxing those sore muscles. Because it uses an infrared light, you don't need to worry about wearing protective eye gear or getting a tan from the machine. You can wear sunglasses if you'd like as the light is still bright. It's just one of the many perks we have for our Black Card membership, we hope you give it a try!"

"#LED #Light #Therapy 
LED therapy uses specific colour wavelengths of light that penetrate the skin at varying depths. The light works to energise cells in the skin to produce collagen, improve elasticity and increase blood circulation and oxygen flow while releasing toxins. 
This stimulates the anti-ageing process, helps to normalise cellular imbalance and improves skin tone and clarity. It is a natural reaction, similar to that of plant photo-synthesis which triggers the body to convert light energy to cell energy. 
Each session of the treatment takes about 20-30 minutes

"216624445"" class=""post""> Okay, this game has to be cheating now. 
I was running Zeus 297, stalling my way through the masks. 
Bladelaw's Luci took out the Mystic Mask easily enough, and I was able to stall long enough to get the laser back up to take out the light mask. 
Then, suddenly, the dark mask just one-shots my team from full health.

That should not be possible. 
Sure, its attack is 42218 while my team's HP is only 41619, but my full-dark resist Akechi wasn't bound so I should have had five percent dark resistance. 
That should have taken its damage down to 40108 - easily survivable from full health. 
Is this the point where I learn that there's some variance to what their actual attack is?

"So I'm at about 15 months. 
I can say that there has been healing, but I'm starting to dobut whether if this is just TSW. 
I've seen a new Nurse Practitioner, who really wants me to go to a bigger city to see an auto-immune specialist. 
She got me worried about possibly having arthritis.

Anyway, I noticed that my face has gotten worse but other places get better. 
My neck is back to being split and oozy. 
I have been doing Red Light Therapy at a suntan studio. 
I started about 4 months ago. 
It does alleviate the oozy, torn and itchy skin. 
I believe it's because it helps with circulation. 
I had 10 days without the red light and my skin just when crazy. 
So at least I know that it helps. 
I know I don't swell up as much as I used to. 
So there's that.

I am hoping that this will end. 
I don't care when anymore, I just want it to happen. 
I'm done putting a deadline to this condition. 
And I'm done trying to explain to people about how much healing I still need or how much I have healed. 
This is getting harder for me to keep positive. 
Although, physically I am better. 
Mentally, I'm getting tired. 
Tired of trying. 
And tired of coping. 
But I know I have to keep going. 
Can't wait to reclaim my life again."

LaserCap, the ORIGINAL take home laser device for laser hair therapy and treatment.

In a nutshell, light therapy improves cellular respiration and function by stimulating the hair follicle cells. Better breathing cells, make for a better functioning hair follicle which, in turn, produces a happier, healthier hair! LaserCap is the original take home laser device for laser hair therapy. Until recently this technology was only available through in-office devices, in hair clinics. With LaserCap LCPRO you can now take it home, making it a much more effective treatment."

"So, as part of my membership with Planet Fitness I have access to their Total Body Enhancement machine. I don't know if it really does anything a all, but it doesn't hurt and I figure anything could only help. The BEAUTY ANGEL experience begins with total body exposure to visible red light energy (non-UV) wavelengths primarily in the 580-700 nanometer range. Working in conjunction with the vibra-shape powered massage and muscle stimulating platform -- and the application of vitamin enriched, aloe infused pro-collagen skin care formulations -- red light energy enhances the overall effectiveness of the complete system. Red light energy is a gentle form of stimulation that will effectively help to enhance your overall appearance. It is the ideal choice for anybody who is looking for a natural, noninvasive way toward looking and feeling great.

"- Photo Rejuvenation -

""Light Therapy""

Photo rejuvenation stimulates fibroblast cell activity in the skin, which increases the production of collagen and elastin--the proteins responsible for your skin's tone and elasticity.

Skin conditions improved by light therapy:

- Tired, aging skin: Softening of lines, folds and wrinkles, healthier circulation, increased moisture and radiance, accelerated skin repair, toned and youthful skin surface, improved elasticity and skin texture.

- Hyperpigmentation -- age spots, freckles, uneven pigmentation due to sun exposure, etc: Most cases of skin hyperpigmentation even out over time from the use of light therapy.

- Acne and blemishes: Light therapy can assist in the repair of acne and blemishes because it stimulates the skin's natural healing process

"Los Angeles aesthetician Shani Darden, a former backup dancer for LL Cool J and Destiny's Child, works from a studio in the back of her home and swears by the light therapy that's supposed to boost collagen and treat acne. 
She's mum about her client list, but Kelly Rowland has posted about her obsession and Katy Perry is a rumored fan. 
Here's what Darden says about the LED facial craze.

Why is LED appealing to musicians?

The mask makes for a really good Instagram. 
But besides that, it's effective and there's less downtime than almost anything else. 
With lasers, you can't walk out the door and perform that night. 
With peels your face can look ragged for a while. 
But with an LED treatment, it takes about an hour, and you see immediate results without any irritation.

Do artists have unique skin issues?

Most artists use a lot of makeup all the time when they're onstage or touring. 
There can be more congestion, more breakouts and a need for more treatments. 
I'll do gentle glycolic peels, extractions and an oxygen treatment under the LED light for about 20 minutes.

Are you ever in awe of stars?

I'm always more honored when I work with my clients. 
I don't get really crazy like that. 
Unless it was Oprah. 
Or Beyonc‚. 
Then I would freak out.

"Recently, I entered into a contract with Tan Republic for ongoing tanning and red light therapy sessions. 
I've been accessing the red light therapy daily and tanning about twice a week. 
All that vitamin D is making me feel great. 
The red light therapy is supposed to help with pain issues caused by arthritis, etc. 
It is also said to help with acne, which I don't have. 
The cost is just under $80 a month, so it's pretty affordable.

If anyone has experience with Tan Republic and/or tanning and red light therapy, I'd appreciate knowing what you think of it."

"Hi Lynn, this is an excellent point I appreciate the comment. It is great to see that you are looking at the research because that is exactly what you need to do to achieve optimal health. You are absolutely right about the results from the ACCORD study. For those who are not familiar the ACCORD study, researchers took 10,000 patients already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and placed them into two treatment groups. In the first group multiple combinations of drugs were used to target an A1C level of <6.0%. The second group was assigned to a standard therapy regimen with a target A1C of 7.0?7.9%. The study was designed to look at a couple different factors with one being to see if aggressive diabetes therapy led to a reduced rate of cardiovascular events. The study found that more people died in the intensive therapy group than the standard therapy group which led many people and health care providers to conclude that lower hemoglobin A1C levels were more dangerous. The problem with this study is the fact that researchers took a group people already diagnosed with diabetes and forced their blood sugar levels down aggressively with multiple drugs in a variety of combinations. There is extensive research to show that elevated blood sugar increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Just to clarify, the treatment goals mentioned in my blog post are the optimal levels I shoot for in the clinic using dietary changes, nutritional balance and lifestyle modifications; not drug therapy. Lowering blood sugar aggressively to optimal levels through drug therapy alone without addressing diet and lifestyle is a recipe for disaster and can lead to a variety of live threatening problems, especially hypoglycemia (blood sugar that is too low). I believe that person is unique and has to be treated as an individual where root causes are addressed and preventive actions are taken to avoid the occurrence of disease. That is the only way to achieve the safest and most effective results. Thank you again for this great comment; it is so encouraging to see people keeping up with the research!"

Golf prevents death

Golf prevents death.

Treating their drowse apnea improved middle-aged men's golf games, according to a uncharitable recent study.

Researchers looked at 12 men with an unexceptional duration of 55 who had moderate to stark obstructive sleep apnea.

The sleep upheaval is characterized by frequent episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep. 
Their golf accomplishment was assessed before and after up to six months of a beauty sleep apnea healing called continuous positive airway squeezing (CPAP), which helps keep a person's airway treeless by providing a steady stream of melody during sleep there. 
The therapy led to less daytime sleepiness and improved sleep-related standing of life.

The men also had a significant 11 percent leave out in their norm golf handicap index, a formula reach-me-down to estimate a player's skill level. 
Among better golfers who had a disability of 12 or less at the start of the study, the customary handicap fell by almost 32 percent after CPAP treatment, according to the study, which was published in the Dec 15, 2013 emerge of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.

The men attributed their improved golf portrayal to factors such as improved concentration, lifetime and resolve making. 
""With the cognitive enhancement afforded by first care of their have a zizz apnea, they saw measurable improvement primeval and more significantly than those who were less skilled,"" Benton said in a journal gossip release hairremovalcream. 
The researchers said most avid golfers in the United States are men old 40 to 70, which is a club with a high take to task of sleep apnea.

"Light therapy is considered a first-line option for major #depressive disorder (MDD) with seasonal pattern or as an adjunct measure for nonseasonal MDD of mild to moderate severity. Light therapy involves exposure to a light box with 10 000-lux intensity slanted toward the face for 30 minutes per day, preferably in the morning. Improvement in depressive symptoms usually occurs within 1?3 weeks. Side effects of light therapy (e.g., headache, eye strain, irritability and insomnia) are usually mild. These can be minimized by starting with 10?15 minutes of exposure per day and gradually increase to 30 minutes/day.

I don't have rosacea but I do have mild seb derm. 
Im not looking for huge results, im looking to improve skin texture, be less flakey, and have less noticeable pores. 
RLT seems almost too good to be true, from someone who has tried it for a length of time, how did it work out, did you see any noticeable improvement in your skin?

I have not tried red light therapy but from what I have learnt from my research I can say that it is not best to try it. 
As it has many side effects associated with it.

If you check online, you will see that several claims are made that RLT helps in anti-aging and can treat acne. 
But in reality, it can result in premature aging of skin and can also increase chances of skin cancer.

So I would suggest you to avoid it and look for other alternatives."

"I take 4,000iu of D3 daily as prescribed by my neuro at the MS clinic of the Montreal Neurological Hospital. When I asked him what he thought about light therapy, he said this option was being studied, but he said that for now, putting my skin at risk is not necessary as the vitamin D supplement does the job. Most Canadians and people in Nordic countries don't have enough vitamin D. Canada has the highest rate of MS in the world. In the summer, spending time in the sun might be enough, for us Canadians, but not in the winter, the rays are not strong enough, and the days are short."

"I don't know, personal preference + scientific curiosity. 
The high quality LED lamps all cost ~150 ?, no matter blue or white.

My other links at least support the photo sensitivity of the receptors for the circadian rhythm to be at ~479 nm, which is blue light.

The safety argument is bogus. 
Some white light devices are qualified as medical products and therefore should be safe to use (the standards for qualification are very high). 
White light is mixed from ""red"", ""green"" and ""blue"" photons / wavelength / energy. 
In the case of the standard 10k LUX white light therapy, you also have a high intensity (W/mý) of blue light.

And yes, the sample sizes are too small for the blue light studies to have definitive answers, but they were equally positive. 
But I am thinking about the physical mechanism behind the treatment, and the theory for blue light sensitivity of melanopsin covered ganglions is an explanation fitting both blue and white light therapy.

The total body enhancement is an exercise and toning system that uses red light therapy and a vibrating plate for a variety of uses such as, skin firmness, improving muscle tone over time and relaxing those sore muscles. Because it uses an infrared light, you don't need to worry about wearing protective eye gear or getting a tan from the machine. You can wear sunglasses if you'd like as the light is still bright."

"LED light therapy is typically used twice a week for a total of twelve sessions. One session really won't do much of anything, and it will also take some time to show any results. Rule of thumb is if it took time for the damage to happen, it will take time to reverse it as well. Facials are similar."
"A South African program aimed at shortening the usual process of HIV diagnosis, counseling, and preparation for antiretroviral therapy led to more people initiating treatment and achieving viral suppression, according to findings from the RapIT study published in the May 10 edition of PLoS Medicine . 
The START and Temprano trials have shown that starting ART promptly reduces the occurrence of AIDS-related events, serious non-AIDS illness, and death.

"Anti ageing to bangalore ? Cutis Clinic

October 17, 2016

Anti-ageing ? lasers

have come to the forefront of anti-ageing beauty treatments in the last few years, and, with stars like Jennifer Aniston having praised the method , we can see the appeal. 
One of the options is a resurfacing treatment. 
This works by the laser removing a layer of skin from the face and causing softer, tighter skin to grow back with less visible blemishes and wrinkles. 
Several treatments are needed for the desired effect.

The other option is photorejuvenation, which works when the laser stimulates the production of collagen in the skin, which ?plumps out? fine lines and wrinkles.

Cutis is the best clinic for anti ageing treatment in bangalore.

"Light therapy -- exposure to artificial light -- can decrease depressive symptoms and normalise circadian rhythms among cancer survivors, finds a study.

""Depressive symptoms are common among cancer survivors' even years after treatment has ended,"" said Heiddis Valdimarsdottir from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, US.

""This interferes with overall quality of life and puts survivors at risk for poor outcomes including death,"" he added.

Most patients face some degree of depression, anxiety, and fear when cancer becomes part of their lives. 
According to the American Cancer Society, one in four people with cancer have clinical depression.

Researchers randomly divided 54 cancer survivors into a bright white light or a dim red light group.

Participants were provided with a light box and asked to use it for 30 minutes every morning for four weeks.

Depressive symptoms and circadian activity rhythms were measured before, during and three months after completing the light exposures to determine the effectiveness of light therapy.

The findings showed that patients exposed to the bright light experienced improvement in depressive symptoms while those exposed to the dim red light experienced no change in symptoms.

""Our findings suggest light therapy, a rather non-invasive therapy, may provide an innovative way to decrease depression among cancer survivors,"" added study co-author William Redd.

The good news is that depression can be treated and bright light therapy is a potentially effective new treatment option, Valdimarsdottir noted while presenting the findings at the American Psychosomatic Society's event in Denver, Colorado.

"Neckhammer mentioned his use of ultrasound to break up the bruise of a patient and his experience sent me searching if other methods of frequency therapy might help.

The link below suggests that red LED light exposure will speed up the break up of a bruise as well as other wounds. 
An internet search of ""red light therapy"" provides a lot of anecdotal evidence that simple, red LED party lights or brooder-type infrared heat lamps provide the benefits.

Unfortunately there is no remedy but this confession.the base of all the miseries about s for the humans is because of the sneaky acts of a group that have pretended like acting positively befor the eyes of others but have been committing the biggest crimes in the private in the past years.this penetration has called all the negative elements.real s could not find even the first needs just to remain alive because they cleaned all its memories to cover their crimes and made it remember what they wanted.all the saleks of groups 9 and 10 have done like this (they have covered black kind it means by force) to cover their crimes in the ancient time.now it is clear why real s had remained behind the negative blocks.real s did its best to save all of them till the last moments this means it could leave them with the big negative elements but did not because of gheyrat otherwise the humans were like particles to it.this text is helping them too because if they continue this they will have so bad destiny as the captives of the negative structure.they can not see yet (light mask as a shelter does not let them see) what real s saw.this text is a typical of the real structural mirror about the humans too.

"Broken Facial Capillaries Often referred to as Spider Veins broken Capillaries are a common skin complaint. Capillaries make up the connecting network between veins and arteries, this delicate network of capillaries are susceptible to damage from a wide variety of environmental factors. The nose and cheek areas are the most common due to exposure to the elements. Broken capillaries appear as red, pink or blue marks often having the appearance of fine threads, hence the term Spider Veins. What causes broken facial capillaries? Fatigue to the walls of the capillaries caused by the wall widening and narrowing too quickly. Often caused by extreme temperature changes, for example, a cold air-conditioned car or the office, then into a hot or vice versa cold climate. Genetics, skin type and the natural ageing process all influence and can be contributing factors. As we age we naturally lose collagen and the production of collagen slows. With losing collagen and skin elasticity in turn making the capillaries more prone to damage. Who suffers from broken capillaries? People suffering from other skin ailments such as Rosacea or severe Acne often suffer from broken capillaries. Fair-skinned or light complexion individuals tend to be the most common sufferers. The Curse of the Celts a common saying for Rosacea sufferers also tend to be inflicted with severe, broken capillaries. How do you treat broken capillaries? Treatment of Broken Capillaries with Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) For deeper vascular problems such as Blue Veins Laser therapy is more effective. Spider Veins or Broken Capillaries are treated with IPL based phototherapy, After treatment the complexion has a more even tone and smoothness. Results are visible immediately, the medical grade light therapy removing the broken capillaries leaving a rejuvenated and regenerated appearance.

Sensitive skin as those that have it know can also cause any number of things, like frequent breakouts, dryness, prolonged redness. 
Some of the reasons why you have sensitive skin can be the result of the products you are using.

Another factor could be your diet, eating foods that cause inflammation like refined grains, ketchup, sweets and coffee to name a few.

In the video below she shows you how to easily you can identify sensitive skin and what to do about it.

"Dark undereye circles can be caused by a host of different things from heredity to allergies to poor sleep. 
Treatments include eye cream, intense pulsed light therapy , skin resurfacing and injectable fillers , but before you choose one it's important to determine the cause.

This is a common problem and are frequently described as ""tired eyes."" 
Although dark circles may be the result of facial aging, they can affect both men and women of all ages and have a variety of causes.

Dark eye circle causes

According to medical experts in the RealSelf community, possible dark circles causes include issues related to facial aging, lifestyle choices, and other causes, which include the following:

Facial aging and dark circles

Dark circles under eyes treatment

Before undergoing dark circles treatment, it is important to know exactly what is causing the dark circles. 
Treatment for dark circles caused by allergies will be different from a dark circles treatment designed to correct bulging under eye fat.

In some cases, a combination of treatments may be appropriate, especially if there are multiple factors causing your dark circles. 
Common procedures doctors recommend to get rid of dark circles include the following (from least invasive):

Dark circle eye cream

Skin lightening with topical bleaching agents may be recommended by your dermatologist to reduce dark circles caused by hyperpigmentation from melasma or sun damage .

Creams like Tri-Luma, which contains hydroquinone, are often recommended, as are products that contain kojic acid, Vitamins C and K, green tea, and licorice.

IPL for eye circles

When blood vessels are visible as dark purple or blue under eye circles, intense pulsed light therapy (IPL or Photofacial ) may be suggested to reduce these dark circles.

Not all doctors agree that it is safe to use IPL near the eyes, however some do recommend it for vascular pigmentation issues, such as dark circles under the eyes.

Skin resurfacing for under eye circles

Laser resurfacing and chemical peel may be used to help reduce dark circles by increasing collagen production, decreasing pigmentation problems, and improving overall skin quality. 
However, laser treatments and chemical peels are most effective when used as part of a combination approach in treating dark circles.

Hyaluronic acid facial fillers for dark circles

Injectable fillers containing hyaluronic acid are often used to correct dark circles created by thinning under eye skin or fat and tissue loss in the under eyes or upper cheeks. 
Restylane is a commonly recommended hyaluronic acid filler for restoring volume to the tear trough or upper cheek area.

Hyaluronic acid fillers are absorbed by the body within a few months to one year, so results are temporary. 
The only permanent filler typically recommended for the under eye area is a patient's own fat.

Fat injections to get rid of dark circles

Like hyaluronic acid fillers, fat may be grafted from another body area and injected in the tear troughs to treat dark circles. 
Fat injections (or fat transfer) are typically recommended for correction of dark circles caused by thinning under eye skin or fat and tissue loss in the under eyes or upper cheeks.

Unlike hyaluronic acid fillers, fat injection results may be permanent, however results are not guaranteed, as fat cells don't always survive the fat transfer process.

Surgery for eye circles

Eyelid surgery, or blepharoplasty , is generally the most effective way to permanently get rid of dark circles.

There are multiple approaches to lower eyelid surgery, and when it is performed to diminish dark circles, it is often combined with one or more of the following surgical procedures: arcus marginalis release, placement of tear trough implants, and the addition, removal, or repositioning of under eye fat.

Cheek lift to correct darkening under eyes

A cheek lift , or mid-facelift , can effectively and permanently correct dark circles caused by cheek descent, or drooping, a common result of facial aging.

In addition to treating dark circles, a cheek lift may be performed to reduce under eye puffiness and deep nasolabial folds.

Dark circles creams

Although over-the-counter eye creams rarely provide a long-term solution with significant results, they may help to reduce or temporarily mask dark circles. 
Popular products for treating dark circles include:

Dark eye circle prevention

There are simple things you can do to alleviate dark circles under your eyes. 
Sometimes the problem is minor or temporary, in which case an inexpensive home treatment may be appropriate."

Thanks! (I think ;-) ) So the 138 goes into the 205, which then goes into the Laraneg, AFTER I remove the glass?

I was completely blown away when i saw this and i wanted to share it because you, or maybe someone you know, is struggling too. Prom and wedding season is coming up and everyone wants to look and feel their best. Nobody should have to feel embarrassed by their skin. Let me help!
This is Lisa's daughter and here's what she had to say: ""Our story is.... she was 15 and had been under a dermatologist's care for several years and nothing was working, prescribed or over the counter... Retin-A, topical antibiotics, light therapy, you name it... I was desperate to find something that would work for her to avoid the years of antibiotics and Accutane that I had endured as a teen. My friend and sponsor introduced me to R+F and it's changed our lives! I jumped in and am loving these products as well as helping others""

"The HydraFacial: Worth Every Penny

February 16, 2016

I apologize for the grainy photos, but the lighting is soft in a facial room and it made for imperfect photos.

Months ago a friend of mine had a HydraFacial and called to tell me how amazing it was. 
Her final words were, ?book one now.? 
I assured her I would and then?life. 
In December La Jolla Cosmetic Surgery Centre contacted me and asked if I would be interested in coming in to try out a HydraFacial and, if I felt so inspired after the facial, to write about my experience. 
I eagerly jumped at the chance, scheduled my appointment and then proceeded to reschedule twice due to sick kids. 
FINALLY, I was able to make my appointment. 
My dear friend was not lying. 
This facial made my skin feel incredible. 
Youthful. 
Plump.

Before she began I snapped a photo of my skin.

This is Cameron, my Aesthetician, explaining how a HydraFacial works. 
She was incredible. 
I spent the entire facial wondering if she would like to go have a glass of wine together and tell me more about skincare and her studies abroad. 
She truly was so filled with information and made skincare sound so interesting I wanted to spend hours with her.

Sounds interesting right? 
You can literally feel moisture being pushed into your skin. 
It?s incredible. 
The Hydrafacial reduces fine lines & wrinkles, helps clear up acne, blackheads & whiteheads, smooths forehead creases & nasolabial folds (without injections!), improves hyperpigmentation & balances coloration, diminishes age spots & visible sun damage, smooths puffy, dark circles under the eyes. 
It really does.

This was literally the bulk of it. 
For nearly an hour she infused my skin with all sorts of feel good, plump up, make my face more vibrant good stuff. 
Technically speaking they would say, ?The DermaBuilder Peptide Complex skin strengthening and smoothing system is a complex of peptides that help to repair and improve the structure of the Dermal-Epidermal Junction by stimulating broad-spectrum collagen/elastin proteins.?

Then she used this little contraption.LED 
Therapy?Blue and Red spectrum LEDs, Blue to improve the appearance of oily, congested skin and to treat moderate inflammatory acne. 
Kills bacteria. 
Red LED helps reduce the appearance of redness and irritation and the signs of aging.

This is the photo I took right after the HydraFacial. 
You can definitely see that the fine lines are less noticeable and my skin tone is much more even. 
The best part is that after a few days it was even more noticeable and the effects lasted for weeks.

I just called to book my next appointment. 
You should too. 
If not here locally at LJSCC, then someplace near you. 
It?s worth every penny.

Share the joy

"Danish researchers found that, turquoise and blue LED light therapy to slow the infant hyperbilirubinemia (Hyperbilirubinemia, commonly known as jaundice) equally effective, this discovery recently published in the ""Nature"" journal.

Aalborg University Hospital (Aalborg University Hospital) located in Aalborg, Denmark, the hospital's pediatric unit researchers Finn Ebbesen lead the research team, testing centers and emission wavelength of light blue LED 459 nm center emission wavelength of 497 nm turquoise shade, the two kinds of light irradiation with the same irradiance in infants suffering from jaundice.

Previous experiments using fluorescent test results show that the central emission wavelength of 490 nm turquoise shade more effective. 
The researchers found that for more than 33 weeks, compared with a slight jaundice babies randomly LED turquoise shade or LED blue light up to 24 hours, the results showed that both shade to reduce the efficiency of bilirubin little difference (p = 0.53).

A total of 46 experimental infants receiving turquoise colored light irradiation, while 45 infants receiving blue light, the results show the baby's bilirubin were reduced by approximately 35.3% (32.5,37.3) and 33.1% (27.1,36.8). 
Therefore, the results of researchers deduced that under the premise of using the LED light, turquoise and blue equally effective treatment for jaundice in babies."
"BioCare?s Lumiwave is an infrared light therapy device. 
That?s a mouthful. 
To help narrow it down, their motto is: Pain Relief the Light Way. 
Easier to understand perhaps.

This device has several parts. 
It is easy to assemble though?it plugs into the wall, then into a handheld controller, and finally is attached to a small belt of plastic disks with lights (light emitting diodes).

This group of light is attached to an appendage by a small Velcro belt. 
You can affix it to an arm, leg or foot, etc. 
When plugged in, it will beep when charged and it then delivers infrared light energy into the tissue of the skin?and this presents as increased tissue temperature.

The lights are meant to result in temporary relief of pain and tension problems you may have from soreness, minor muscular joint pain and stiffness (they say, including the back). 
The device ups local blood circulation and helps with muscle spasms and minor ?chronic pain that is associated with arthritis, sprains or strains?.

I?ve used it numerous times because my daily activity level is high?I walk at least five to eight miles a day with little to no break. 
Over the period of three weeks I?ve used it every night and like it very much. 
This local device is applied for 20 minutes (self-timed) and a good time to meditate. 
There is also a shorter ten-minute therapy time. 
It is mildly stimulating heat-wise but does provide relief.

If you are getting or have arthritis, if you have muscular pain from an injury, or you are even sore from sleeping incorrectly or just developed repetitive strain injury, this is one tool you can put in your kit of remedies. 
Of course, live with whatever treatments benefit you and your body but with the side effects of drugs, this is probably a better alternative.

Hey! 
I am 21. 
I am really worried and concerned about my skin like all other girls. 
We had a beach volleyball match a week ago. 
I had used the sunscreen of SPF 50. 
But I had sunburns and I am terribly tanned. 
My friend suggested a photofacial treatment in Beauti-med, Port Coquitlam. 
I tried many home remedies like milk and honey, orange peel mask etc, but of no use, Will a photofacial treatment be effective? 
I asked her about this but she has no previous experience. 
She is just researching about this topic. 
Has anyone done this treatment before? 
I cannot afford it if it is not effective. 
So please advice."

Then, suddenly, the dark mask just one-shots my team from full health.

That should not be possible. 
Sure, its attack is 42218 while my team's HP is only 41619, but my full-dark resist Akechi wasn't bound so I should have had five percent dark resistance. 
That should have taken its damage down to 40108 - easily survivable from full health. 
Is this the point where I learn that there's some variance to what their actual attack is?

Did you take a picture? 
If one of the leads (you used A Luci too?) was bound your total hp would have been reduced. 
When I beat it the dark mask never attacked me, just kept binding. 
My total hp was 43,565.

The unknown galaxy ray:there is the supernatural war between our real planet earth and another real planet.there are two parts in the pure sabab world (the world of physics and chemistry) one is about the human beings and one is about the materials .the unknown galaxy ray changes the space of the points of brains as the minds also flaws the energy points.but it makes just the mutations about the materials.these two parts are interacting and there are the harmonies between them.physics and chemistry are trustable but the mutations make all the negative happenings about the materials.real s has been the guard against this ray.it was how what it saw in the pure sabab supernatural cave (pure sabab supernatural means the power of id and this ray against each other) were negative for example all the special groups were committing the biggest crimes because of the property of this ray but seen for the future).now the leeway of real s has finished because its capacity has been filled therefore this ray is slanting.light mask 1 and 2 (two black elements of real s) and two halves of model maker (two white elements of real s) were the shields of the humans they were the most powerful (they are the cortical layers of id) but the special groups saw them as ordinary human) this means they are getting annihilated (the giving birth) but real s has done what the special groups will need in the future (when they will be born) in past 35 years.it and the family will remain as the guarantee benchmark till leaving this world (probably it will not be long).i have intentionally written these texts without prevarication because this ray and the negative power elements (as just their negative points for the positive humans) are unable about this kind of act with honesty.they are able about hidden things this is why somethings like black magic are unlawful (this is ignorance and lets it maneuver) and brings superstitions in the sabab world because it is hidden and unknown.the only way is the structural science and it is protected as the sanctions about what real s has done for the future.a typical of changing the points is when i wrote the past messages it seemed bullying whereas i was helping.the special groups wasted the time to reveal and real s remained in nonsense.also the prostitution got strong (the negative energy) in the sabab world.real s was the most oppressed in the history and the humans will know what the matter is after giving birth (the annihilation).if they did not waste the time it would not get annihilated when givin birth.they can know now why i said the humans are like particles in comparison to real s and why it and the family are the guarantee benchmarks in the sabab world too.

"A gastric balloon that is swallowed rather than surgically implanted is safe to use and leads to similar weight loss , a study has found.

Until now, gastric balloons have to be placed in the stomach by endoscopy, with the patient sedated, and then removed by the same procedure.

But the pill-sized Elipse is swallowed by the patient in its pill-sized collapsed form.

An attached catheter then inflates it with 550ml of fluid over 10 minutes, and the catheter detaches.

After four months, a valve opens to deflate the balloon for excretion from the body.

Holyoke Medical Centre, Massachusetts, studied 34 obese patients using the Elipse, who lost an average 10kg ? or 9.5% of their body weight.

Dr Ioannis Raftopoulos said: ?Weight loss was similar to endoscopically placed balloons. There were no serious adverse events.?

""In addition, Elipse therapy led to a significant improvement in waist circumference, blood sugar control, and overall quality of life.""He added that 90% of patients reported satisfaction with the procedure and indicated that they would recommend it to a friend.

Dr Raftopoulos said: ""As a temporary intervention that does not require anatomic modification, Elipse is a less invasive and reversible path to weight loss.

""Elipse may enable patients to remain at a healthy weight through repeat use of the device without requiring anaesthesia, incisions, or surgical risks.""

Manufacturer Allurion Technologies now intends to conduct a larger, randomised, controlled clinical trial in the USA.

The findings were presented to the European Obesity Summit in Gothenburg."

"By Molly Peterson - COLUMBIA, Mo. 
? Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease that causes progressive degeneration in the nerve cells that control muscles, thereby causing muscle weakness and eventually death. 
SMA affects approximately 200,000 people in the U.S., often children. 
Now, researchers at the University of Missouri are studying a subtype of SMA, spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), and have developed a gene replacement therapy that can be used to treat and control the disease in the future.

SMARD1 is a rare genetic condition with high mortality rate that develops primarily between the ages of six weeks and six months. 
The condition targets the spinal cord and leads to atrophy of body muscles and paralysis of the diaphragm, which is responsible for breathing. 
As the disease progresses, children with a SMARD1 diagnosis become paralyzed and require continuous artificial ventilation. 
The average life expectancy of a child diagnosed with SMARD1 is 13 months. 
Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for this disease. 
?Monogenic diseases like SMARD1, a disease that is caused by one gene, are ideal for gene therapy since the goal of the therapy is to replace the missing or defective gene,? said Chris Lorson , an investigator in the Bond Life Sciences Center and a professor of veterinary pathobiology. 
?Our goals for this study were to develop a vector that would improve the outcomes of the disease and for the vector to be effective in a single dose.?

Lorson and Monir Shababi , associate research professor in the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine , developed a gene replacement therapy that was administered to infantile mice with a SMARD1 diagnosis. 
The therapy has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and directly targets motor neurons affected by SMARD1.

?One of the most remarkable aspects of this type of gene-replacement therapy is that it will last for an extended period of time,? Lorson said. 
?The ability of the therapy to cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective barrier that typically prevents toxins or microbes from entering the brain, opens the door for IV administration, allowing us to target motor neurons with a relatively non-invasive procedure.?

The study determined that a low dose of the gene-replacement therapy led to significant improvements in muscle strength, protein expression in motor neurons and an extension in life span of the SMARD1 mouse model. 
The results of this study indicate that gene-replacement therapy is a potential treatment option for SMARD1.

With the results from this study, Lorson and his team are working to develop a most suitable delivery system for the gene replacement therapy; they want to determine the exact dose of the vector needed, when in the disease cycle the therapy will be most effective, and where in the body to administer for best outcomes.

The study, ?Rescue of a Mouse Model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy With Respiratory Distress Type I by AAV9-IGHMBP2 is Dose Dependent,? recently was published in Molecular Therapy and was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, a MU Research Board Grant and a MU College of Veterinary Medicine Research Grant.

"Light Therapy
Psoriasis Institute

Natural ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun and controlled delivery of artificial UV light are used in treating psoriasis. It is important that light therapy be administered by a doctor. Spending time in the sun or a tanning bed can cause skin damage, increase the risk of skin cancer, and worsen symptoms.

Sunlight. Much of sunlight is composed of bands of different wavelengths of UV light. When absorbed into the skin, UV light suppresses the process Fleading to disease, causing activated T cells in the skin to die. This process reduces inflammation and slows the turnover of skin cells that causes scaling.
Ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy. UVB is light with a short wavelength that is absorbed in the skin?s epidermis. An artificial source can be used to treat mild and moderate psoriasis. Some physicians will start treating patients with UVB instead of topical agents. A UVB phototherapy, called broadband UVB, can be used for a few small lesions, to treat widespread psoriasis, or for lesions that resist topical treatment. This type of phototherapy is normally given in a doctor?s office by using a light panel or light box. Some patients use UVB light boxes at home under a doctor?s guidance.

Another type of UVB, called narrowband UVB, emits the part of the UV light spectrum band that is most helpful for psoriasis. Narrowband UVB treatment is superior to broadband UVB, but it is less effective than PUVA treatment (see next paragraph). At first, patients may require several treatments of narrowband UVB spaced close together to improve their skin. Once the skin has shown improvement, a maintenance treatment may be all that is necessary. However, narrowband UVB treatment is not without risk. It can cause more severe and longer lasting burns than broadband treatment.
Psoralen and ultraviolet A (UVA) phototherapy (PUVA). This treatment combines oral or topical administration of a medicine called psoralen with exposure to UVA light. UVA has a long wavelength that penetrates deeper into the skin than UVB.
Psoralen makes the skin more sensitive to this light. Compared with broadband UVB treatment, PUVA treatment taken two to three times a week clears psoriasis more consistently and in fewer treatments. However, it is associated with more short-term side effects, including nausea, headache, fatigue, burning, and itching. Care must be taken to avoid sunlight after ingesting psoralen to avoid severe sunburns, and the eyes must be protected with UVA-absorbing glasses. Long-term treatment is associated with an increased risk of squamous-cell and, possibly, melanoma skin cancers."

"Anti ageing treatment ? Cutis Clinic

October 17, 2016

Anti-ageing ? lasers

have come to the forefront of anti-ageing beauty treatments in the last few years, and, with stars like Jennifer Aniston having praised the method , we can see the appeal. 
One of the options is a resurfacing treatment. 
This works by the laser removing a layer of skin from the face and causing softer, tighter skin to grow back with less visible blemishes and wrinkles. 
Several treatments are needed for the desired effect.

The other option is photorejuvenation, which works when the laser stimulates the production of collagen in the skin, which ?plumps out? fine lines and wrinkles.

Cutis is the best clinic for anti ageing treatment in bangalore.

"TECFIDERA (DMF) and SHINGLES?

Letter in New England Journal of Medicine:  

We report a 23-year-old male patient with psoriasis who was treated with DMF (Fagron). After 2 months of treatment, fever, skin lesions unrelated to psoriasis, and cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy developed (Figure 1Figure 1
Clinical Images and Histopathological Features.
). Histopathological findings were consistent with herpesvirus infection. Polymerase-chain-reaction testing confirmed the diagnosis of varicella?zoster virus (VZV) infection; serologic testing was positive for IgM antibodies to VZV, but there was no IgG response. The patient had no documented lymphocytopenia (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Because his medical history mentioned chickenpox during childhood, we made the diagnosis of generalized VZV infection.

The DMF treatment may have reactivated the VZV infection in this patient, because the infection developed 2 months after the initiation of treatment, he never received ultraviolet-light therapy, and he did not use topical glucocorticoids. This case suggests that patients treated with DMF may have an increased risk of viral infection, even in the absence of lymphocytopenia.

"Light therapy decreased depressive symptoms and normalized circadian rhythms among cancer survivors, according to new research from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai presented today at the American Psychosomatic Society in Denver, CO.

Researchers from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Northwestern University in Chicago, University of Iowa, University of California in San Diego and Reykjavik University in Iceland randomly divided 54 cancer survivors into a bright white light or a dim red light group. 
Participants were provided with a light box and asked to use it for 30 minutes every morning for four weeks. 
Depressive symptoms and circadian activity rhythms were measured before, during and three months after completing the light exposures to determine the effectiveness of light therapy .

""Depressive symptoms are common among cancer survivors even years after treatment has ended,"" said Heiddis Valdimarsdottir, PhD, Associate Professor of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and lead author of the study. 
""This interferes with overall quality of life and puts survivors at risk for poor outcomes including death.""

Patients exposed to the bright light experienced improvement in depressive symptoms while those exposed to the dim red light experienced no change in symptoms.

""Our findings suggest light therapy, a rather non-invasive therapy, may provide an innovative way to decrease depression among cancer survivors,"" said William Redd, PhD, Professor of Oncological Sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.

Most patients face some degree of depression, anxiety, and fear when cancer becomes part of their lives. 
According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 4 people with cancer have clinical depression.

""The good news is that depression can be treated, and bright light therapy is a potentially effective new treatment option,"" said Dr. Valdimarsdottir.

"New Laser Treatment Approved for #Psoriasis
Psoriasis Institute

If you're living with psoriasis, you know how uncomfortable and embarrassing the red, itchy, scaly skin can be. Treatment options for psoriasis include steroid cream or other medicated creams, oral medications, and light therapy.

All of these treatments work well, but medications can have side effects and light therapy requires a regimen of three sessions a week for two to three months.

Today, there is another option for treating psoriasis: excimer lasers, which deliver ultraviolet light to localized areas of the skin. This treatment uses intense, focused doses of laser light to help control areas of mild to moderate psoriasis without harming healthy skin around them. Targeted laser therapy is similar in effectiveness to traditional light therapy, but it works in fewer sessions with stronger doses of light that can reach deeper into the affected skin. The handheld laser wands are also good for reaching psoriasis in hard-to-treat areas, such as the elbows, knees, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and scalp."

"(04-12-2015 04:14 PM)urpussysucker Wrote: Scientists put final pieces into place for seeing cancer with protons

New Delhi, Dec 3 (ANI): Scientists are currently putting together a unique medical imaging platform that could improve treatment for millions of cancer sufferers by making proton therapy a viable option.

Members of the multi-national research team behind the PRaVDA (Proton Radiotherapy Verification and Dosimetry Applications) project, led by the University of Lincoln, UK, are now building the instrument that will produce for the first time detailed three-dimensional images of a patient's anatomy using protons rather than x-rays.

To produce these Proton CT images, the world-first technology will use the same high energy particles that are used to destroy a tumour during proton therapy treatment.

Like x-rays, protons can penetrate tissue to reach deep tumours. 
However, compared to x-rays, protons cause less damage to healthy tissue in front of the tumour, and no damage at all to healthy tissue lying behind, which greatly reduces the side effects of radiation therapy.

Led by Nigel Allinson from the University of Lincoln, the PRaVDA team aims to become the first in the world to produce clinical-quality Proton CT imagery. 
They are currently working near Cape Town at the South African National Cyclotron - a type of particle accelerator.

Allinson said: ""Proton therapy is an improved approach for treating challenging tumours especially in the head and neck, and near critical organs. 
It is likely to become the preferred radiotherapy method for most childhood cancers, as the unwanted exposure to radiation of healthy tissue is much reduced and so the risk of second cancers later in life is also much reduced.

He added that having the ability to administer a high dose in a small region is the main underlying advantage of proton therapy, however accurate planning is absolutely essential to ensure that the dose does not miss the target tumour.

The PRaVDA researchers believe that Proton CT will soon be used as part of the planning process for cancer patients, as well as during and after treatment.

Proton therapy is rapidly gaining momentum as a cancer treatment around the world. 
The NHS will open two proton therapy centres in 2018 and up to another four private centres are also planned for the UK. (ANI)

"KYW Medical Reports Sponsored By Independence Blue Cross

By Dr. Brian McDonough, Medical Editor

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) ? Seasonal affective disorder or SAD is a form of depression that typically starts in fall and winter, when there?s less sunlight outside, and then fades away in spring and summer.

Over the years we have learned that both talk therapy and light therapy can help reduce a sad mood. 
But which technique is better?

According to a report in the American Journal of Psychiatry, the one to one talk therapy seems to be more effective. 
Of course most of the attention is given to the light therapy where people sit in front of a light box for several minutes every day. 
The very bright artificial light stimulates the body much like the sunshine and it has been shown to be effective.

SAD is a very real problem and whatever treatment you choose, it is something you should think about having looked at.

"THE TREATMENT of pernicious anemia with cobalamin is one of medicine's great success stories. 
However, the usual practice of giving the drug as an intramuscular injection has several drawbacks. 
Injections can be painful, difficult to provide for some patients who are elderly or living alone, 1 and costly if given by health professionals. 
2 It is therefore not surprising that the search for an oral preparation began soon after cobalamin was isolated and introduced for parenteral use in 1948. 
Preparations containing oral intrinsic factor were tried, but antibody production caused some patients to become refractory and relapse. 
3 Other studies revealed that a small but constant proportion of an oral dose of cyanocobalamin was absorbed without intrinsic factor, so that by sufficiently increasing the dose, adequate absorption could be attained.

"The Revage 670 Laser is a low-level laser treatment for thinning hair. 
The system, utilizing Rotational PhotoTherapy (RPT), contains 30 laser diodes that rotate 180 degrees around the scalp. 
This dynamic process increases the contact of the laser energy with the hair follicles and thus is potentially more effective in stimulating hair growth than hand-held lasers.

The Revage 670 Laser is a safe and painless laser system. 
It has been issued an accession number by the FDA. 
This means that the product is classified as a cosmetic product and has met the international laser standard for safety.

Studies with the device have shown that the low level laser produces an 85% success rate in halting the progression of hair loss and up to a 39% increase in fullness.

Treatments are administered twice per week for 6 weeks and then once a week for the next 16 weeks. 
Once hair growth has been observed, periodic touch-ups may be needed to maintain the benefits of the treatment. 
Each treatment session takes approximately 30 minutes.

Laser light therapy with the Revage system is particularly suitable for women, as laser treatments work best when there are diffuse regions of thinning in the scalp, rather than completely bald areas ? the pattern most commonly seen in female pattern hair loss. 
Since the laser light serves to thicken fine, miniaturized hair, it is particularly suitable in these thinning areas. 
The Revage system is able to penetrate down to the hair follicles and deliver a uniform field of energy in these areas."

"The iGrow Hair Growth System is a digitized hair helmet that stimulates follicle thickness and strength. 
Unlike invasive and expensive hair replenishment procedures, this at-home gadget lets users invest in a more budget-conscious remedy for hair loss.

Powered by LLLT (Low Level Light Therapy) technology, the iGrow Hair Growth System resembles a bike helmet but is smaller in size and shaped to fit snugly around one's skull. 
The helmet uses laser light energy to stimulate follicle growth in areas that feature thinning or sparse hair.

This hair rejuvenating device is not only convenient -- the light therapy helmet can be worn while reading, watching television or even while at work -- but is also 100% safe and medically tested."

My skin is very oily and acne prone. 
Recently I consulted my dermatologist and she said that I have hives. 
She said that it might be due to an allergic reaction to some medications.Is 
there any permanent cure for this? 
I am considering an acne scar smoothing treatment ( http://www.beauti-med.com/cosmetic-se

But will it help in my case? 
Any previous experiences?

Dr.Jason Tsai is a state-certified Acupuncture Physician and a Doctor of Oriental Medicine (Taiwan) as well as a Certified Chi Kung Instructor and an experienced mediator.  Dr. Tsai graduated from Hong Kong University in 1992 and also studied at the Taiwan Chinese Cultural University, and worked at the Har-Ping Hospital.  Afterwards he went to China to study additional methods of Acupuncture at 3 different universities.  When he worked at the Chinese Tian Ging Hospital he treated many stroke patients.  He later came to the United Stated and opened his own acupuncture clinic in 1996.

Dr. Tsai?s primary concern is always the patients? well-being. He believes in providing caring, individualized treatment for all of his patients.  By combining traditional acupuncture with electro-therapy, bio-magnetics, and infra-red light therapy, patients receive doubly-effective treatments.  Dr. Tsai utilizes acupuncture and high-tech therapy to assist in the correction of facial aging, hormonal imbalance, and accident-related injury."
@sbitsandbobs it's a nice day time light mask. I think those wanting heavy moisturising would be disappointed. Perfect for what I was after yesterday though ??

Light Therapy Panels Brighten Up Bus Stops During Winter TakeBackYour.News  #News #Energy #Technology #Environment
"Bright light treatment either alone or combined with an antidepressant was an effective and well tolerated treatment for adults with nonseasonal major depressive disorder (MDD) in a randomized clinical trial, according to an article published online by JAMA Psychiatry .

MDD is among the leading causes of disability worldwide and is associated with impaired quality of life and an increased risk of death. 
Treatments include psychotherapies and antidepressants but remission rates remain low so more therapeutic options are needed. 
Light therapy has been effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Raymond W. Lam, M.D., of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, and coauthors conducted a double-blind and placebo-and-sham-controlled trial to test the efficacy of light treatment alone and in combination with fluoxetine hydrochloride compared with a placebo treatment involving an inactive device and a placebo pill.

The eight-week trial randomized 122 patients: light therapy (30 minutes/daily exposure to a fluorescent light box as soon as possible after awakening) and placebo pill (n=32); fluoxetine (20 mg/daily) and placebo device (a negative ion generator, n=31); combination light and fluoxetine treatment (n=29); or placebo device and placebo pill (n=30). 
The change in a common depression rating scale score was the study's primary outcomes.

The authors report combination therapy and light therapy alone were superior to placebo but fluoxetine alone was not superior to placebo.

Why light therapy appears to work is still unknown but hypotheses in SAD involve resynchronizing circadian rhythms. 
Nonseasonal MDD also may be associated with disturbances in the circadian rhythms, according to the authors.

The authors note limitations of the study including not measuring patients' natural light exposure.

""Further studies exploring mediators and moderators of response will be important,"" the study concludes.

#Sassy Blue Light Therapy For Acne: Does It Work? bit.ly/1O5YuHC
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease that causes progressive degeneration in the nerve cells that control muscles, thereby causing muscle weakness and eventually death. 
SMA affects approximately 200,000 people in the U.S., often children. 
Now, researchers at the University of Missouri are studying a subtype of SMA, spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), and have developed a gene replacement therapy that can be used to treat and control the disease in the future.

SMARD1 is a rare genetic condition with high mortality rate that develops primarily between the ages of six weeks and six months. 
The condition targets the spinal cord and leads to atrophy of body muscles and paralysis of the diaphragm, which is responsible for breathing. 
As the disease progresses, children with a SMARD1 diagnosis become paralyzed and require continuous artificial ventilation. 
The average life expectancy of a child diagnosed with SMARD1 is 13 months. 
Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for this disease.

""Monogenic diseases like SMARD1, a disease that is caused by one gene, are ideal for gene therapy since the goal of the therapy is to replace the missing or defective gene,"" said Chris Lorson, an investigator in the Bond Life Sciences Center and a professor of veterinary pathobiology. 
""Our goals for this study were to develop a vector that would improve the outcomes of the disease and for the vector to be effective in a single dose.""

Lorson and Monir Shababi, associate research professor in the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine, developed a gene replacement therapy that was administered to infantile mice with a SMARD1 diagnosis. 
The therapy has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and directly targets motor neurons affected by SMARD1.

""One of the most remarkable aspects of this type of gene-replacement therapy is that it will last for an extended period of time,"" Lorson said. 
""The ability of the therapy to cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective barrier that typically prevents toxins or microbes from entering the brain, opens the door for IV administration, allowing us to target motor neurons with a relatively non-invasive procedure.""

The study determined that a low dose of the gene-replacement therapy led to significant improvements in muscle strength, protein expression in motor neurons and an extension in life span of the SMARD1 mouse model. 
The results of this study indicate that gene-replacement therapy is a potential treatment option for SMARD1.

With the results from this study, Lorson and his team are working to develop a most suitable delivery system for the gene replacement therapy; they want to determine the exact dose of the vector needed, when in the disease cycle the therapy will be most effective, and where in the body to administer for best outcomes."

Dr. Graebe Sees the Light (Therapy)

Sep 30 2016Sep 30 2016 Matthew Hall

Dr. Rick Graebe, a behavioral optometrist in Versailles, is a visual specialist who thinks outside the box, but even he was skeptical of syntonic-photo therapy or light therapy.

Here?s how it works: Patients look down a device called a syntonizer, a two-and-a-half foot tube with a light bulb at the bottom equipped with different filters.

Proponents claim that the filtered light alters photo receptors in brain cells that boost a patient?s visual system.

?Nobody was a bigger skeptic than me,? Dr. Graebe said.

Since 1990, Dr. Graebe has practiced Visual Therapy, which is a kind of physical therapy for the eyes, mind and body that treats the entire visual system.

When he heard about syntonic-photo therapy, it sounded ?too far out there.?

Despite his skepticism, his peers told him success story after success story treating migraines, lazy eye and other visual issues.

At the behest of one colleague, Dr. Graebe attended an international syntonic-photo therapy conference in Florida. 
If he didn?t like the conference, his colleague suggested, he could make it a beach vacation instead.

The science began to persuade Dr. Graebe, but he remained skeptical. 
Finally, when he observed that light therapy could change a person?s autonomic nervous system, he made it part of his Visual Therapy protocol.

The autonomic nervous system governs reactions beyond a person?s control such as heart rate and pupil dilation.

?This isn?t something like, ?Oh, this helped my Aunt Susie,?? Dr. Graebe said.

?This is not just anecdotal. 
Change in your pupil is not something you can fake.?

Many children suffer academically because their autonomic nervous system is in a constant state of ?fight or flight.? 
These children will usually have constricted fields when tested by Dr. Graebe, and their pupils are perpetually enlarged.

Pupils should only expand when they are in reduced illumination or when someone is in a heightened excitability state or danger.

When someone?s pupils are continuously enlarged, it creates tunnel vision and ratchets up stress levels.

Light therapy can balance the autonomic nervous system, which will be evidenced when pupils shrink to a normal level.

This shrinking of pupils is what ultimately convinced Dr. Graebe. 
Because people cannot control the size of their pupils, light therapy was making an impact.

While witnessing improvement in his patients who used the therapy, Dr. Graebe reported improvements in himself ? fewer headaches, less stress.

?I do it myself,? Dr. Graebe said. 
?I?ve calmed down and this has helped me have fewer head and body aches.?

Newcastle hospital set to save patients from long-distance treatment nightmare

16 Aug 2016 By Craig Thompson

Iona Gillespie, Alvin Bencito and Prof Matt Collin from Newcastle's Freeman Hospital

Patients will no longer have to travel hundreds of miles for lifesaving treatment thanks to a hospital breakthrough.

Up until now seriously ill North East Bone-Marrow Transplant patients have to travel to Rotherham for specialised care. 
This can involve an overnight stay just at a time when their immune systems are compromised, or they may be too sick to travel. 
Now, Newcastle?s Freeman Hospital, with help from North East Blood cancer charity Bright Red, have been able to purchase two pioneering ECP machines. 
ECP - extracorporeal photopheresis - is a form of light therapy used in treating patients with ?graft versus host? disease (GVHD) which can be a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.

GVHD can happen after a transplant from another person when particular types of white blood cells in the donated bone marrow or stem cells start to attack the patient?s own body cells. 
The GVHD may affect different areas of the body, most commonly the skin, digestive system and the liver. 
In some cases, it can be fatal.

Patient Lee Roden, 34, from Cramlington in Northumberland, has been travelling to Rotherham General Hospital for ECP treatment for the past two and a half years, totalling over 40 tiring round trips and overnight stays during that time. Lee had a bone marrow transplant in November 2012 to treat blood cancer but then developed GVHD which spread from his skin, to his lungs and ultimately his mouth, affecting him so badly he was unable to eat solid food.

Lee said: ?Six years ago, I was diagnosed with leukaemia and my life was turned upside down. 
Since then, I?ve had to have chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant and for the past two and a half years have been travelling backwards and forwards to Rotherham for ECP treatment. 
It?s been a difficult time for myself and for my wife Cheralyn, but I?m hugely grateful to the amazing team of people who have looked after me at the Freeman Hospital and to the ECP team at Rotherham. 
It?s made an unbelievable difference being able to have this treatment and I?m so glad I was fit enough to travel. 
When I started ECP, I had raw, open wounds in and around my mouth. 
I can now eat solid food again and I?m getting better and better all the time. 
Having this service available now at the Freeman Hospital will benefit so many more patients in our region who perhaps could not make the journey before.?

"1. Beta-blockers were commonly used in the treatment of coronary artery disease in the 1980s, though prior studies were inconclusive due to limitations in study design and small sample sizes.

2. This was the first large, randomized trial to demonstrate that propranolol significantly reduced mortality after acute myocardial infarction when compared with placebo.

Original Date of Publication: March 1982

The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) was established in 1977 to study whether daily administration of propranolol after a myocardial infarction would lead to a reduction in total mortality. 
Prior to this study, beta-blockers were well known to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and suppress arrhythmias. 
They were also widely used in the setting of coronary artery disease, although numerous studies exploring this question were inconclusive due to small sample sizes and study design issues.

In summary, patients with recent hospitalization for myocardial infarction experienced significantly lower all-cause mortality when taking propranolol rather than placebo. 
Moreover, propranolol therapy led to significantly lower rates of cardiovascular mortality and sudden death. 
Patients taking propranolol experienced significantly higher rates of bronchospasm and diarrhea, but fewer instances of palpitations when compared to placebo. 
The BHAT was the first large, randomized trial to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality when treating patients with recent myocardial infarction with a beta-blocker, and beta-blockade remains a staple in the management of acute myocardial infarction.

[randomized controlled trial]: The BHAT was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted at 31 institutions in the United States and Canada. 
Patients were eligible for the study if they were between 30-69 years of age and hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction. 
Exclusion criteria were having a contraindication to propranolol (marked bradycardia), a history of severe heart failure or asthma, other life-threatening illness, a need for cardiac surgery, or a previous need for beta-blocker therapy. 
A total of 3837 were enrolled and randomized to treatment with propranolol 40 mg every eight hours or placebo. 
The propranolol dose was subsequently titrated up to 60 mg or 80 mg every eight hours.

The majority of patients enrolled in this study were white males, comprising over 80% of the study population. 
Compared with patients who received placebo, those in the propranolol group experienced significantly lower all-cause mortality (7.2% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.005). 
Patients taking propranolol also experienced significantly lower cardiovascular mortality (6.6% vs. 8.9%, p < 0.01), arteriosclerotic heart disease mortality (6.2% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), and sudden death (3.3% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.05) compared to those treated with placebo.

There were significantly more instances of bronchospasm (31.3% vs. 27.0%, p < 0.005) and diarrhea (5.5% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.01) in the propranolol group, though palpitations were more common in the placebo group (10.8% vs. 15.1%, p < 0.001).

"The planned activities included the exploration of the kids' senses through the use of various materials such as musical instruments, fabric and tissue paper in the creation of maracas, and participation in light therapy, and yoga with aromatherapy.

The workshop began with the ever-popular Jamming Session, whereby kids, volunteers, and staff used the crafty musical instruments from our Hope Home Box to explore sound, movement and touch. 
The loud noises and smiles within the room seemed to reflect the kids enjoyment of this activity.

While this was happening, the high-energy kids were busy at work creating their colorful, noisy maracas. 
Various materials were used to decorate plastic bottles, and the bottles were later filled with pasta, rice, and stones before being sealed. 
I think that it is fair to say that there was an organised, fun mess within the room. 
The kids were delighted with their creations and later paraded their maracas in the form of a marching band to allow the low-energy kids to experience their creations and partake in the atmosphere created. 
As the kids and staff enjoyed the yoga so much last week, we decided to conclude this weeks workshop with another yoga session. 
During the 12 step yoga flow which was led by Hallie, there were various aromatherapy senses sprayed throughout the room to trigger the participants' senses of smell. 
It was evident that everyone gave it their best shot at the yoga poses, and there were some mismatched moves and stumbles along the way which added to the enjoyment.

We believe that this was a successful workshop. 
As the activities were planned in accordance to the various energies within the group, all kids got the opportunity to explore and enhance their senses using various materials and aromas during the duration of the workshop. 
Also, the high-energy kids created the maracas, which we believe will be an enjoyable resource for all at Hope Home in the future."

"Recently, I entered into a contract with Tan Republic for ongoing tanning and red light therapy sessions. 
I've been accessing the red light therapy daily and tanning about twice a week. 
All that vitamin D is making me feel great. 
The red light therapy is supposed to help with pain issues caused by arthritis, etc. 
It is also said to help with acne, which I don't have. 
The cost is just under $80 a month, so it's pretty affordable.

If anyone has experience with Tan Republic and/or tanning and red light therapy, I'd appreciate knowing what you think of it."

"Can Red Light Therapy Help Your Dog's Pain?

Dogs hurt for a multitude of reasons and it's frustrating as a dog owner when you can't figure out exactly what is ailing them.

There's a solution that has been used for years but many people just don't know about it. 
It's called Red Light Therapy and has proven to alleviate pain from a multitude of ailments including arthritis, anxiety, itchy skin, injuries, and many more!

Stimulates a strong heart beat by regulating serotonin levels. 
Serotonin helps to regulate inflammation and allergic reactions and plays an important role in blood clotting, stimulating a strong heart beat, initiating sleep, and fighting depression. 
It also stimulates the smooth muscle in the intestinal wall helping it to contract."

"I'm trying to add a decal system in my DirectX engine but i'm facing some problems with the quality of the textures projected. 
Every other no decal texture look fine, but these ones look really bad.

What I do in the shader is:

float4 PSDecal( in float4 iPosition : SV_Position ) : SV_Target { int3 ss_load_coords = uint3(iPosition.xy, 
0); float3 wPos = txWorldPos.Load(ss_load_coords).xyz; 
float4 lightSpacePos = mul(float4(wPos,1), LightViewProjection); lightSpacePos.xyz /= lightSpacePos.w; lightSpacePos.x = (lightSpacePos.x 
+ 1) * 0.5; lightSpacePos.y = (1 - lightSpacePos.y) * 0.5; float4 light_mask = txLightMask.Sample(samLightBlackBorder, 
lightSpacePos.xy); if (lightSpacePos.w 
< 0) light_mask.xyzw 
= .0; 
return light_mask; }

Here you can see the result decal, the original texture and the projection space of the decal:

In the last image you can see there are noticeable artifacts, and thats why the resulting image gets distorted, but I don't understand why...

Also, I have the same problem when generating the light shadows, they get pixelated too. 
In this case, the shadow map is being calculated correctly, and it's not distorted.

Maybe it's the world position that is being loaded?"

Micro-Needling, also referred to as Derma-Rolling, or even Collagen Induction Therapy (CIT), is a revolutionary skin rejuvenating treatment that reduces the appearance of scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, even cellulite
It is regarded to be as effective as laser resurfacing
When the small handheld rolling device called a derma-roller which is covered with tiny needles rolls along the skin, it creates tiny holes without damaging the epidermis, thereby triggering the skin?s natural healing response. #microneedling #scars #skincare #dermabrasion #needle #scarremoval #scartreatment #like4like #likeall #likeus #l4l #likeeverything #likebackteam #like4tags #followme #followus"

The A E Skin Soft and Smooth Rejuvenation treatment is a two-step procedure designed by Dr. Alex to address color and texture in a single session.

The first step is a Forever Young BBL IPL photofacial treatment. This step uses bright light to target dark spots and blood in the skin. This works well for sun damage, age spots, broken capillaries, and generalized redness.

The second step is a Micro Laser Peel. This step uses a different laser to remove a thin layer of dead skin cells from the surface. This exfoliates the skin to improve the texture. It also enhances the results of the first step by allowing the pigment to exfoliate faster. It also works well to address acne because it removes the dead skin cells which clog pores.

"Hi Starr ? I have had psoriasis for a decade, and I've done it all: light therapy, topical steroids, changing my diet to avoid gluten and dairy, and the spots persist. The next step my doctor wanted me to take was the immunosuppressant drugs-- a scary step for me. I have seen many many testimonials about a product called plexus: they are  health supplements that target gut health, and there are more and more studies that link poor gut health to autoimmune diseases. 

I wanted to know that I exhausted every option before I tried injectables. So I am trying plexus! If you have any questions, let me know and we can chat. We are in this together, and we all deserve relief."

Red light therapy (also known as Total Body Enhancement) is an exercise and toning system that uses red light therapy and a vibrating plate for a variety of uses such as, skin firmness, improving muscle tone over time and relaxing those sore muscles. Because it uses an infrared light, you don't need to worry about wearing protective eye gear or getting a tan from the machine. You can wear sunglasses if you'd like as the light is still bright. It's just one of the many perks we have for our Black Card membership, we hope you give it a try!"

"However, when treating rosacea consult with a dermatologist first or before using any over the counter rosacea treatments.

1. Cleanse skin with liquid 2% salicylic acid cleanser. 
This gentle cleanser reduces inflammation and redness without irritating skin.

2. Applying topical Pycnogenal based cream for rosacea or gel can benefit the capillary system and help reduce redness and inflammation associated with rosacea. 
Alpha lipoic acid and green tea extract moisturizer are also great products for rosacea.

3. Scrubbing, rubbing, using abrasive exfoliants or wash cloths exacerbates rosacea. 
Never use these exfoliants.

4. Avoid saunas, sun exposure, cold winds, hot tubs, exfoliants, smoking, stress, spicy or hot foods, and hot beverages as these will likely trigger an outbreak.

5. Some other rosacea remedies include avoiding sour cream, yogurt, chocolate, soy sauce, vinegar, navy beans, lima beans, pea pods, spinach, eggplant, tomatoes, bananas, citrus fruits, raisins, plums, figs and liver can help prevent outbreaks. 
Recommended foods include antioxidant-rich vegetables such as broccoli, artichokes, asparagus, green beans, leafy lettuces and fruits such as blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, peaches, plums and cantaloupe.

6. Avoid alcohol (red wine, vodka, gin, beer, champagne and bourbon) hot coffee, hot cider, hot chocolate and tea.

7. Avoid cosmetics and products containing fragrance, alcohol, peppermint, witch hazel, menthol, Retinoids (Retin-A, Renova) and facial masks.

8. Zinc (50 mg.) and Vitamin A (10,000 I.U.) daily can help minimize rosacea. 
Vitamin B-12 injections have been known to help remedy rosacea.

9. Mineral makeup can help camouflage redness associate with rosacea.

10. Rosacea home treatment can be done in just a few sessions of LED Red Light Therapy which can help diminish the red flush of rosacea. 
It?s also anti aging, helps diminish wrinkles, tightens skin, help refine pores and can help fade pigmentation spots.

11. Try another form of rosacea care called IPL Photofacials that can help diminish the rosacea symptoms and pigmentation problems. 
However it can be costly at about $300 to $500 a session and usually five to six sessions are required."

The therapy led to less daytime sleepiness and improved sleep-related grandeur of life.

The men also had a significant 11 percent exclude in their mean golf handicap index, a formula old to estimate a player's skill level trusted2all.com.

The men attributed their improved golf dispatch to factors such as improved concentration, lifetime and finding making. 
""With the cognitive enhancement afforded by eminent curing of their rest apnea, they saw measurable improvement initially and more significantly than those who were less skilled,"" Benton said in a journal rumour release stomach. 
The researchers said most avid golfers in the United States are men ancient 40 to 70, which is a gathering with a high scold of sleep apnea.

Blue light therapy was actually FDA approved over a decade ago, for the treatment of severe acne. Many of the blue light treatments for acne use the same wavelengths needed to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA, which means the technology is already commercially available.?

"Washington University scientists led by Samuel Achilefu, PhD, have devised a way to apply light-based therapy to deep tissues never before accessible. They delivered light directly to tumor cells, in the form of an imaging agent frequently used in PET scans. This light source, along with a novel cancer-targeting product and a chemotherapy drug, selectively kill cancer cells. The method is aimed at treating patients with many different types of breast cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer, which often doesn?t respond to conventional therapies. Dr. Achilefu also plans to explore whether light therapy can prevent a recurrence of breast cancer if it is used as an annual treatment.

"Scientists funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health have found that a greater number of patients with coronary artery disease may benefit from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery than previously thought. 
CABG ? a surgical procedure to help improve blood flow to the heart by bypassing arteries clogged with cholesterol plaques ? was thought to be too risky for patients with the long-term effects of coronary artery disease: left ventricular dysfunction (when the left side of the heart is unable to pump normally) and heart failure. 
Studies of the safety and effectiveness of CABG in the 1970s excluded most patients with these two conditions. 
The procedure was typically used to relieve angina, or chest pain. 
?With limited data showing any benefit for patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, physicians and patients were less likely to engage in such an invasive, and thus risky, procedure as CABG for diagnosis and treatment,? said lead author Eric J. Velazquez, MD, FACP, FACC, FASE, FAHA, of Duke University Medical Center. 
?Patients with these conditions largely received medical therapy alone and had poor outcomes.? 
), to evaluate whether CABG plus guideline-directed medical therapy had a durable benefit over medical therapy alone for patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. 
The researchers found that CABG added to medical therapy led to significantly lower rates of death and hospitalization among patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. 
?Our results usher in a new era in the treatment of coronary artery disease because we now have evidence that with CABG and medical therapy, there is a 16 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause over 10 years,? Dr. Velazquez said. 
He added that there is also a median survival benefit of nearly a year and a half, and that he and his team saw that the addition of CABG to medical therapy prevented a death from any cause for every 14 patients they treated. 
Their data further suggest that the reduction in the risk of death could be even greater in real-world practice. 
?Conducting this trial was critically important to determine in a scientifically rigorous study that CABG improves survival for individuals with coronary artery disease and compromised left ventricular function,? said NHLBI Director Gary H. Gibbons, MD. ?The current 10-year follow-up provides new important insights about patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from CABG as compared to medical therapy alone. 
As such, we now have a solid evidence base to inform patient care and the future development of clinical practice recommendations.? 
Dr. Velazquez noted that the results are particularly important because the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure is expected to increase to approximately 8 million individuals by 2030 in the U.S. alone. 
The increase in the projected prevalence is a result of advances in the management of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, increasingly transforming coronary artery disease into a chronic disease with long-term effects such as left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. 
George Sopko, MD, MPH, the program director in NHLBI?s Division of Cardiovascular Sciences who administered the study grant, added that this investigation, published in The New England Journal of Medicine (April 2016), is one of only a few cardiovascular trials with 10 years of follow-up and with approximately 98 percent of the patients followed throughout the study period. 
?It is unusual to have this quality of follow-up for so long,? said Dr. Sopko. 
?It speaks to the rigor of the results.? 
He added that the results are very generalizable, as the study included a diverse patient population spread across 22 countries and various health systems."

This light mask made my head hurt AND made everything turn green
"Members of the multi-national research team behind the PRaVDA (Proton Radiotherapy Verification and Dosimetry Applications) project, led by the University of Lincoln, UK, are now building the instrument that will produce for the first time detailed three-dimensional images of a patient's anatomy using protons rather than x-rays.

To produce these Proton CT images, the world-first technology will use the same high energy particles that are used to destroy a tumour during proton therapy treatment.

Like x-rays, protons can penetrate tissue to reach deep tumours. 
However, compared to x-rays, protons cause less damage to healthy tissue in front of the tumour, and no damage at all to healthy tissue lying behind, which greatly reduces the side effects of radiation therapy.

Led by Nigel Allinson from the University of Lincoln, the PRaVDA team aims to become the first in the world to produce clinical-quality Proton CT imagery. 
They are currently working near Cape Town at the South African National Cyclotron - a type of particle accelerator.

Allinson said: ""Proton therapy is an improved approach for treating challenging tumours especially in the head and neck, and near critical organs. 
It is likely to become the preferred radiotherapy method for most childhood cancers, as the unwanted exposure to radiation of healthy tissue is much reduced and so the risk of second cancers later in life is also much reduced.

He added that having the ability to administer a high dose in a small region is the main underlying advantage of proton therapy, however accurate planning is absolutely essential to ensure that the dose does not miss the target tumour.

The PRaVDA researchers believe that Proton CT will soon be used as part of the planning process for cancer patients, as well as during and after treatment.

Proton therapy is rapidly gaining momentum as a cancer treatment around the world. 
The NHS will open two proton therapy centres in 2018 and up to another four private centres are also planned for the UK."

"Luke, could you possibly be getting the wood oils into your system through your skin?

Have you tried wearing gloves?

If the gloves don't help, then at least you know it's from dust. 
You can then try a very light mask, or some kind of fan / extraction as other have mentioned.

Also - What woods are you cutting? 
Some exotics like Rosewood, Cocobolo, Cedar, and Ebony are well-known to cause reactions. 
Even if you are using something more common, perhaps if you switch species ......

Sorry to hear about this. 
What a bummer."

What is a light therapy lamp? 
Sounds intriguing. 
Is that one of those lamps that increases brightness slowly like sun coming up for an alarm clock?

Having done this a few days now ... mornings are really groggy. 
Tempted to do as Kyonin mentions and have a coffee beforehand. 
But that requires waking up earlier! 
Gah ! 
hahahaha

I suppose this is good for me to work through.

It's a set of very bright LED lights in small frame that simulates the brightness of a sunny day.

"New research has shown that light therapy can decrease symptoms of depression, as well as normalize circadian rhythms, among cancer survivors.

?Depressive symptoms are common among cancer survivors even years after treatment has ended,? said Heiddis Valdimarsdottir, Ph.D., an associate professor of oncological sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and lead author of the study. 
?This interferes with overall quality of life and puts survivors at risk for poor outcomes, including death.?

For the study, researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Northwestern University, University of Iowa, University of California in San Diego, and Reykjavik University in Iceland randomly divided 54 cancer survivors into two groups.

Participants were provided with a light box and asked to use it for 30 minutes every morning for four weeks. 
The boxes either had a bright white light or a dim red light.

Depressive symptoms and circadian activity rhythms were measured before, during, and three months after completing the light exposures to determine the effectiveness of the light therapy.

The study found that patients exposed to the bright light experienced improvements in depressive symptoms, while those exposed to the dim red light experienced no change in symptoms.

?Our findings suggest light therapy, a rather non-invasive therapy, may provide an innovative way to decrease depression among cancer survivors,? said William Redd, Ph.D., a professor of oncological sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.

Most patients face some degree of depression, anxiety, and fear when cancer becomes part of their lives. 
According to the American Cancer Society, one in four people with cancer have clinical depression.

?The good news is that depression can be treated, and bright light therapy is a potentially effective new treatment option,? said Valdimarsdottir.

"Hey Bernadette- I just posted this above. I have had psoriasis for a decade, and I've done it all: light therapy, topical steroids, changing my diet to avoid gluten and dairy, and the spots persist. The next step my doctor wanted me to take was the immunosuppressant drugs-- a scary step. 

I have seen many many testimonials about a product called plexus: they are  health supplements that target gut health, and there are more and more studies that link poor gut health to autoimmune diseases. 

I wanted to know that I exhausted every option before I tried injectables. So I am trying plexus! If you have any questions, let me know and we can chat. We are in this together, and we all deserve relief."

"Welcoming a new baby to the family is something most parents joyously look forward to. But raising a newborn can be challenging, and there are several health conditions that parents should be aware of during the first weeks and months of an infant?s life. Small babies often have a distended stomach after a large feeding, but during the time between feedings the stomach should be soft. A hard distended stomach is often caused by gas or constipation, which is not cause for alarm. But a child?s pediatrician should be contacted if the abdomen is swollen, the infant is vomiting, or if the baby has gone more than two days without having a bowel movement, as these symptoms can be the sign of an undiscovered intestinal issue. Most newborns and young infants occasionally spit up after a feeding, but some babies suffer from painful acid reflux that can cause several issues. Infants with acid reflux may have issues gaining weight if they constantly expel the contents of their stomachs. Acid reflux can also cause pain as the stomach acid enters a baby?s esophagus, which can result in excessive crying and problems sleeping. There are several treatment options that parents can do at home to help a baby with reflux, such as do smaller feedings more often, keep a baby upright after feedings, and have the baby sleep at an incline to help keep stomach acid down. But more serious cases of reflux may require prescription liquid antacids, and in extreme cases surgery may be necessary to prevent permanent damage to the esophagus. It is not uncommon for newborns to look slightly yellow shortly after birth?this is referred to as jaundice, and it occurs because the liver is not yet effective at removing bilirubin from the bloodstream. Mild cases typically resolve themselves, but the condition has to be closely monitored because if bilirubin levels in the blood become too high a newborn can suffer damage to the brain or nervous system. Bilirubin levels typically peak between 3 to 5 days old, so if a baby is discharged from the hospital at less than 3 days old it is important for the parents to make an appointment with a pediatrician within 2 days so the infant can examined. The typical treatment for jaundice is light therapy, which helps the body break down bilirubin in the blood. Breathing problems in infants are often caused by blocked nasal passages; this issue can typically be resolved by using saline nose drops and a bulb syringe to clear the nose. But some newborns have more serious breathing problems that require immediate medical attention. If a newborn is breathing unusually fast, retracting during each breath (taking extremely deep breaths that causes the ribs to stick out), grunting while breathing, or has flaring nostrils while breathing it is important to take the child to the pediatrician right away. Concerns about a newborn?s breathing should never be ignored, whether he or she has one symptom of a problem or several symptoms.

this old nasty cold weather, has a way of making everyone feel down, so try and cheer up, spring is just around the bend...

I've been reading about Vitamin D deficiency and learned that the body makes Vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. 
Lack of Vitamin D can make you feel down.

These past few days were cloudy and cold and I didn't go out much at all. 
Days without bright sunlight make me down.

We evolved with the sun and need it to be healthy.

I can't wait for spring time to get here and warmer weather. 
Spring time and 70 deg weather is my favorite time of the year.

We just need to make it though the last few weeks of Jan and though February. 
By March the sun will be popping out more often and the weather should start to warm up hopefully. 
And if not by March then surly by April.

Until then there is always light therapy."

COLUMBIA, Mo. - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease that causes progressive degeneration in the nerve cells that control muscles, thereby causing muscle weakness and eventually death. 
SMA affects approximately 200,000 people in the U.S., often children. 
Now, researchers at the University of Missouri are studying a subtype of SMA, spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), and have developed a gene replacement therapy that can be used to treat and control the disease in the future.

SMARD1 is a rare genetic condition with high mortality rate that develops primarily between the ages of six weeks and six months. 
The condition targets the spinal cord and leads to atrophy of body muscles and paralysis of the diaphragm, which is responsible for breathing. 
As the disease progresses, children with a SMARD1 diagnosis become paralyzed and require continuous artificial ventilation. 
The average life expectancy of a child diagnosed with SMARD1 is 13 months. 
Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for this disease.

""Monogenic diseases like SMARD1, a disease that is caused by one gene, are ideal for gene therapy since the goal of the therapy is to replace the missing or defective gene,"" said Chris Lorson, an investigator in the Bond Life Sciences Center and a professor of veterinary pathobiology. 
""Our goals for this study were to develop a vector that would improve the outcomes of the disease and for the vector to be effective in a single dose.""

Lorson and Monir Shababi, associate research professor in the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine, developed a gene replacement therapy that was administered to infantile mice with a SMARD1 diagnosis. 
The therapy has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and directly targets motor neurons affected by SMARD1.

""One of the most remarkable aspects of this type of gene-replacement therapy is that it will last for an extended period of time,"" Lorson said. 
""The ability of the therapy to cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective barrier that typically prevents toxins or microbes from entering the brain, opens the door for IV administration, allowing us to target motor neurons with a relatively non-invasive procedure.""

The study determined that a low dose of the gene-replacement therapy led to significant improvements in muscle strength, protein expression in motor neurons and an extension in life span of the SMARD1 mouse model. 
The results of this study indicate that gene-replacement therapy is a potential treatment option for SMARD1.

With the results from this study, Lorson and his team are working to develop a most suitable delivery system for the gene replacement therapy; they want to determine the exact dose of the vector needed, when in the disease cycle the therapy will be most effective, and where in the body to administer for best outcomes.

###

The study, ""Rescue of a Mouse Model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy With Respiratory Distress Type I by AAV9-IGHMBP2 is Dose Dependent,"" recently was published in Molecular Therapy and was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, a MU Research Board Grant and a MU College of Veterinary Medicine Research Grant."

"Good to hear that things are improving! 
I feel with our skin conditions - everything is very delicate so even when we take two steps forward, oftentimes quite soon down the line we're taking a step back but it's definitely good to keep up and keep moving forward!

I'm in the middle of packing up a houseful of stuff by myself, haven't bought a dust mask yet so doing things very very slowly but looking forward to LED therapy later this afternoon. 
Face is a bit red hot from running back and forth from the airport and trying to juggle packing with saying goodbyes!!

Bromelain's been working quite well for me, I haven't had to use antihistamines as much, which is awesome! 
Hope it works for you too

I'm also at an all time high of drinking liquids all day - about 10-12 glasses a day (my eyebags are gone so that's a bonus but of course as a chick I'm always scouting restaurants etc for the nearest restrooms lol) - that seems to be helping alot. 
Staying away from super cold fluids still and also finding that warm water with lemon is super soothing for me for some reason.

"ANSR SKIN CARE: Branding + Packaging

When this startup company came to us for branding an effective new technology that uses light therapy to diminish acne, they didn?t even have a name. 
For anyone who suffers from acne, there never seems to be a real answer. 
So we named it ANSR: By using clean, identifiable colors and symbols, we communicated the positive feeling of the brand and the simplicity of its use. 
The first phase of the project involved branding and packaging the product for online retail and direct mail, so we devised a self-mailing package with every element considered. 
When it was time to expand the line and package it for department stores, we named the two products Beam and Halo. 
The next step was to create a new packaging system and photography (by Eric Rose) suited to the high-end cosmetics industry."

I have 2 light lines across my forehead that have been driving me nuts lately and would like to attempt to lighten them up before the wedding. 
However Botox scares the crap out of me. 
I hate the idea of injecting a toxin my face and the long term effects we may not know about. 
I was reading about light therapy. 
Any experiences with that or something else that helped?

Thanks bees!"

"Green light therapy is also amazing for skin. Increases collagen, elastin, brightens skin and reduces redness and brown spots. I don't experience migraines, but from first hand experience I know the healing and rejuvenating properties of light wavelengths. I can certainly see the potential of this being a natural, holistic alternative to toxic chemical pharmaceuticals.

Instead of buying the ridiculously expensive gadgets for light therapy, I bought this high intensity light and it works extremely well.

"Sometimes used to treat skin conditions, mood disorders, and sleep disorders, light therapy consists of exposure to specific wavelengths of light for a prescribed amount of time. 
Visible violet light is used to activate a naturally occurring compound that kills acne-causing bacteria, while sunlight-mimicking light boxes and other infrared lights are used to treat seasonal affective disorder, a winter-related depressive disorder.

Light therapy, long used to help improve mood in people who get the blues when days are darker and shorter, can also treat non-seasonal depression, a small Canadian study suggests.

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders and a leading cause of disability and reduced quality of life worldwide, the researchers note in JAMA Psychiatry.

While many people with depression may be helped by medication or psychotherapy, these options don't work for everybody and some patients don't stick with treatment due to side effects or challenges related to access or affordability.

""This study is the first to show that light therapy alone is effective versus a placebo, and the first to compare combination light and drug to light alone,"" said lead study author Dr. Raymond Lam of the University of British Columbia.

""The combination of light therapy and antidepressant was the most effective,"" Lam added by email. ""However, some people may prefer to try a non-medication treatment first, and may elect to start with light therapy.""

To test the effectiveness of light therapy for non-seasonal depression, Lam and colleagues randomly assigned 122 patients to one of four groups for eight weeks: only medication, only light, a combination of drugs and light therapy, or a control group that received no active treatments.

The active treatments in the study included a daily 20-milligram dose of fluoxetine (Prozac) and daily exposure to a fluorescent light box for 30 minutes after waking up each morning.

Researchers gave people assigned only light therapy a placebo, or inactive pill, and they provided participants assigned only to drug treatment with an inactive device instead of a working light box. The control group received both the placebo pill and the inactive device."

"Anti ageing treatment in bangalore

October 17, 2016October 17, 2016

Anti-ageing ? lasers

have come to the forefront of anti-ageing beauty treatments in the last few years, and, with stars like Jennifer Aniston having praised the method , we can see the appeal. 
One of the options is a resurfacing treatment. 
This works by the laser removing a layer of skin from the face and causing softer, tighter skin to grow back with less visible blemishes and wrinkles. 
Several treatments are needed for the desired effect.

The other option is photorejuvenation, which works when the laser stimulates the production of collagen in the skin, which ?plumps out? fine lines and wrinkles.

Cutis is the best clinic for anti ageing treatment in bangalore.

"Light-box therapy typically used to treat people with seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, during the winter months can also ease symptoms of depression that occur throughout the rest of the year, a study suggests.

The authors of the study, which was funded Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), hope that their findings contribute to the improvement of the lives of people with depression.

This study ?shows a new, proven-safe treatment of depression that is probably both more effective and less expensive than drug treatment or anything else?, said Dan Kripke, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the topic but was not involved in the latest trial. 
About 60 per cent of study participants using both light therapy and an anti-depressant were nearly back to normal, compared to about 45 per cent using light therapy alone, and 30 per cent of participants who received the placebo.

?These results are very exciting because light therapy is low-cost, easy to access and use, and comes with few side effects?, said Dr. Raymond Lam, a professor at the University of British Columbia, in a. ?Patients can easily use light therapy along with other treatments such as antidepressants and psychotherapy?. 
A few participants were instead given placebo pills and placebo devices.

The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression.

Light therapy alone was better than placebo, but not from a statistically significant point of view, Lam said.

Experts can?t say for sure why light therapy works, but for seasonal affective disorder they think it may help correct disturbances in the body?s circadian rhythms, or internal clock.

?More and more people are seeking help because there is less stigma about having depression?, said Lam. ?It?s important to find new treatments because our current therapies don?t work for everyone?. 
?Another theory is that light affects neurotransmitters in the brain such as serotonin [which affects mood]?, he said.

Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant.

However, questions remain, Lam said, such as how long the combination treatment should continue. 
One group got 30 minutes of bright light treatment a day and took a placebo pill, while another used a device that was not light therapy and took fluoxetine. 
?We really need to have these options available for people?."

Premature wrinkling and dis-pigmentation of the skin is not only something many people find unappealing to look at, but they can also be visible indications that the skin is damaged at the cellular level. 
And damaged skin is less able to function as well to defend our insides from environmental stressors and disease. 
As we get older, our skin is often the first place we see the signs of aging. 
Facial wrinkles and discoloration are the culmination of damage and is accelerated by sun exposure, facial expressions, tobacco use, poor nutrition, and various skin disorders. 
So, when it comes to feeling better both inside and out, skin rejuvenation procedures and treatments are beneficial for not just our visible outer appearance, but for our overall health as well.

What is photo-aging?

Unlike the natural aging process, photo-aging is caused by the skin?s exposure to UVA and UVB rays from the sun, tanning beds, and even fluorescent lighting. 
Using a good, high-quality, broad-spectrum sunscreen with zinc oxide and reapplying it every 90 minutes to 2 hours is the best way to combat photo-aging and UV damage. 
But even with perfect, diligent protection, it?s almost impossible to stop the effects of photo-damage.

Skin Rejuvenation Options

Facials, Microdermabrasion, Chemical Peels

Laser Treatments

Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) photofacial

Radiofrequency (RF) treatment

Fillers

Neuromodulators (Botox, Dysport, Xeomin)

Surgery

The goal for these rejuvenation treatments is to provide an individually tailored solution to restore the skin?s elasticity, texture, and pigmentation. 
But prevention is always better than correction when it comes to keeping your skin healthy and vibrant.

Preventive methods

UV protection: sunscreen with 6% or higher zinc oxide, layered clothing (including UPF clothing), umbrellas, hats

Avoid tanning

Quit Smoking

Use a home care regimen that is appropriate for the individual needs of your skin

Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet

Exercise

"Nue Fusion Microcurrent Machines

Skin for Life Nue Fusion Microcurrent machines are recommended by many licensed professionals across the United States and in Europe. 
Beauty professionals like the versatility of using multiple frequencies, and having multiple choices of programs, individual frequencies, and overall machine intensities. 
This brings more of an individualized approach to skin tightening, firming, and maintaining a youthful appearance.

Microcurrent is the easiest way to bring instant gratification, while continually building a vibrant illuminating appearance for long term skin health.

Nue Fusion microcurrent machines are manufactured in the USA, at our Brooksville corporate headquarters. 
We have been manufacturing equipment since 2003.

Our Nue Fusion Microcurrent may be incorporated with performance massage techniques, microdermabrasion, ultra-scrubber, oxygen infusion, and LED Light Therapy,

giving an extra boost for firm and resilient skin."

"Hey, everyone! The total body enhancement is an exercise and toning system that uses red light therapy, for a variety of uses such as, skin firmness, improves muscle tone over time and has a vibrating plate that helps relax muscles. Because it uses an infrared light, you don't need to worry about wearing protective eye gear or getting a tan from the machine. You can wear sunglasses if you'd like as the light is still bright. The total body enhancement does help with skin blemishes and cellulite, you may use it with or without your clothing but you will see better results with less clothing acting as a barrier between your skin and the light therapy. If you haven't already, you should stop by for a tour. We'd love to show you around and answer any additional questions you may have! :D"

I've been reading about Vitamin D deficiency and learned that the body makes Vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. 
Lack of Vitamin D can make you feel down.

These past few days were cloudy and cold and I didn't go out much at all. 
Days without bright sunlight make me down.

We evolved with the sun and need it to be healthy.

I can't wait for spring time to get here and warmer weather. 
Spring time and 70 deg weather is my favorite time of the year.

We just need to make it though the last few weeks of Jan and though February. 
By March the sun will be popping out more often and the weather should start to warm up hopefully. 
And if not by March then surly by April.

Until then there is always light therapy.

Or.......we could take a trip to Fla. to fish in the sun!"

Phoebe! IPL or Photofacial Therapy is a great treatment for hyperpigmentation and facial redness. It helps to eradicate these problems while stimulating collagen production. We love it too!
"written by Syuzi Pakhchyan January 17, 2012

It?s not often that we see e-textiles used as an elixir for stress. 
As much as LEDs can be a shriek for attention (look no further than the Black Eyed Peas stagewear) , they also can be used to create a meditative environment according to AHO design students.

Developed by Coralie Rocque, Maria Bacus Edvardsen and Aleksander Imset Wassum, Slenduro is an electronic wind chime designed to create a ?a relaxing interactive installation.? 
Part of the charm of the installation is its use of natural materials such as wool and home grown crafting techniques (knitting and crocheting). 
Interacting with the crocheted wool tendrils causes the ?snowballs? to illuminate and play a melody.

Students Silje Maloney Barth, Siren Dversnes, Yen Sigird Cheung and Siri Yran take a more holistic approach with their project HYSJ. 
HYSJ is an entire built environment that incorporates a woven carpet with embedded LEDs and a rocking chair. 
The ?relaxation? strategy is, at first, to overwhelm the visitor with a bit of sensory overload and then blanket them in calmness. 
I do question the bizarre strategy but I?m sure it has some alluring effect.

"The Best DIY Exfoliating Mask

November 4th, 2015

In the video below I will teach you how to prepare the best DIY exfoliating mask. 
However what I don?t teach you are the types of exfoliation. 
You might find this interesting and is actually very useful information.

Knowing the types of exfoliation might help you make a better choice. 
Mechanical means to exfoliate with things such as a washcloth or loofah. 
You are essentially scrubbing away dead skin cells. 
Another aspect is to use skin care products containing abrasive elements like sugar, salt, tiny granular particles. 
You can also remove dead skin cells with products that have enzymes and help break down the proteins of dead skin cells. 
Finally, you can choose products that contain acid such as beta-hydroxy or salicylic acid that will exfoliate the skin.

Some of these means of getting rid of dead skin cells can be used in combination. 
For example, I use a combination of elements for my Exfoliating Mask. 
The results are amazingly soft and radiant skin.

Exfoliation is the corner stone of skincare but don?t over do this step. 
My rule of thumb is to do it twice a week. 
This is safe enough for just about anybody to do. 
And lastly, choose your product wisely.

Lastly shop at our flag ship salon, 501 5th Ave. 
Ste 1203. 
New York, NY 10017 and to make your appointments call 212.949.2350.

"Ultraviolet Light Therapy - light rays in certain concentrations actually change your cells (with xrays & gamma rays being the worst and causing cancer with the least exposure) and the idea is to give you ""just enough"" to stimulate the body's own repair system but not enough to disfigure or cause cancer. It's supposes to stimulate collage growth and repair and in the ""healing process"" recreate a youthful appearance. Imho, they're going to discover in the long term studies that it's just like the temporary boost we get from the sun (tan, rush of blood that is actually a result of severe damage but looks youthful and ""healthy"" at first, tightness & plumpness from the inflammation) then later you have spots, freckling, melanin deposits, wrinkles, sagging, loss of elasticity, and Cancer."

"Clear skin is possible... 
A clinical study shows that treating the skin with the combination of special wavelengths of blue+red light clears mild to moderately severe inflammatory acne better and faster:

""We found a final mean improvement of 76% in inflammatory lesions using a combined blue?ñred light radiation which was significantly superior to those achieved by blue light or benzoyl peroxide."" 
July 2000 - British Journal of Dermatology

Red light therapy has also been shown to rejuvenate the skin, stimulate collagen production, prompt cellular repair and increase circulation for a more vibrant and youthful complexion. 
Brightened skin tone and improved skin texture have also been reported.

This same technology used by dermatologists is now available in the Clear BI-LIGHT for home use. 
Using this superior combination of special wavelengths of blue and red light, Clear BI-LIGHT clears and prevents acne breakouts, calms inflammation and rejuvenates the skin better and faster. 
And does it in a way that's completely safe."

The total body enhancement is an exercise and toning system that uses red light therapy, for a variety of uses such as, skin firmness, improves muscle tone over time and has a vibrating plate that helps relax muscles. Because it uses an infrared light, you don't need to worry about wearing protective eye gear or getting a tan from the machine. You can wear sunglasses if you'd like as the light is still bright. The total body enhancement does help with skin blemishes and cellulite, you may use it with or without your clothing but you will see better results with less clothing acting as a barrier between your skin and the light therapy.

"Anti aging treatment in bangalore

October 18, 2016October 18, 2016

Anti-ageing ? lasers

have come to the forefront of anti-ageing beauty treatments in the last few years, and, with stars like Jennifer Aniston having praised the method , we can see the appeal. 
One of the options is a resurfacing treatment. 
This works by the laser removing a layer of skin from the face and causing softer, tighter skin to grow back with less visible blemishes and wrinkles. 
Several treatments are needed for the desired effect.

The other option is photorejuvenation, which works when the laser stimulates the production of collagen in the skin, which ?plumps out? fine lines and wrinkles.

Cutis is the best clinic for anti ageing treatment in bangalore.

"This startup company came to us to brand an effective new skincare technology that uses light therapy for anti-aging and acne, but they needed a name. 
For anyone who suffers from acne, there never seems to be a real answer, which led us to the name ANSR: Using identifiable symbols and clean colors, we communicated a positive, user-friendly feeling for the brand. 
The first phase of the project involved branding and packaging for direct mail. 
We devised a self-mailing package with every element considered. 
When the brand expanded into retail at department stores. 
We named their two products Beam and Halo, then created a new packaging system suited to the high-end cosmetics industry."

[Powerful, medical grade, pain treatment LED lights ]

LED treatments will do similar to soft/cold/low level laser, but takes a lot longer to get results ( 15-30 min and more sessions) vs the low level laser which a spot treatment might only take 20 seconds.

I was hoping it was a low level laser for that price, I have been watching for the cost of LLLT to come down.

"A 24-hour exposure to bright blue light before surgery reduces inflammation and organ damage at the cellular level in a mouse model, according to new research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

The finding, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests a potential pre-treatment light therapy that could improve outcomes in patients undergoing procedures characterized by a period of blood restriction, such as liver resection or organ transplantation. 
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

?We were incredibly surprised by our results,? said senior author Matthew R. Rosengart, MD, MPH., associate professor in the Pitt School of Medicine?s departments of Surgery and Critical Care Medicine. 
?There?s long been evidence suggesting that light and circadian rhythms profoundly influence our biology, and specifically the physiological response to stress. 
So while we were expecting to find some correlation with light spectrum and the immune response, we were not expecting results quite so striking,?

Light is complex and consists of intensity, duration of exposure and wavelength. 
This study is

Rosengart and his team compared what happened when mice were exposed to red light, ambient white fluorescent light similar to that in hospitals and high-intensity blue light 24 hours before kidney or liver surgery involving periods of blood restriction and restoration.

The high-intensity blue light outperformed the red and white light, attenuating cellular and organ injury through at least two cellular mechanisms. 
The blue light brought about a reduction in the influx of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell involved in inflammation, which can lead to organ damage and other problems. 
Additionally, blue light inhibited dying cells from releasing a protein called HMGB1 that triggers organ-damaging inflammation.

The team then tested whether the blue light was acting through the optic pathway or some other mechanism, like the skin. 
Blind mice had the same healing response regardless of whether they were exposed to blue or red light, indicating that the protective impact of blue light does, indeed, act through the optic pathway.

The team then looked at whether one color of light might disrupt the circadian rhythm, which is linked to immunity, more than another. 
Blood from mice exposed to red, white and blue light had similar concentrations of melatonin and corticosteroid hormones. 
Furthermore, the mice under each of the lights also had similar activity levels. 
These data indicate that the effects of blue light were not mediated by a disruption of sleep, activity or circadian rhythms.

Rosengart stressed that mice are nocturnal animals with visual, circadian and immune biology that is distinct from humans. 
Thus, the results of his study should not be broadly extended to patients or hospital settings until robust clinical trials have been performed to show whether or not pretreatment with intensive blue light is safe.

"?Neuro-laser? treatment, or near-infrared light therapy (NILT), may be a possible new therapy to help spur the brain to repair itself after a TBI.

As explained in a study authored by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, and published recently in Neural Regeneration Research , this ?neuro-laser? treatment?high-powered multi-watt coherent infrared light?has the ability to reach into the brain and activate brain reparative processes, such as the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, following a traumatic brain injury.

?Only multi-watt neuro-laser has sufficient energy to penetrate skin and skull, reaching the deep parts of the brain where injuries are, with no irritation to the skin or other side effects,? Henderson says in a media release from the Neuro-Laser Foundation (NLF) .

?The patients are responding very positively, and our data is consistently showing robust responses. 
This treatment is really helping turn lives around. 
The stories we?re hearing are amazing,? adds Henderson, a co-founder of the Neuro-Laser Foundation, who is spearheading the treatment along with NLF co-founder Larry Morries.

?The need is tremendous. 
We suspect there are many other ways NILT could help the brain heal,? Morries states in the release.

The patent-pending method outlined in the study utilizes specific laser instruments designed to Henderson?s and Morries? specifications. 
The number of required applications is low, and the treatment is reportedly safe in the hands of trained professionals, the study suggests, per the release.

"For those of us living in the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice and least amount of daylight is fast approaching, as is the risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

An estimated 1 20 percent of Americans are affected by SAD each winter, suffering from the blues, fatigue, and in some cases, more serious depression as sunlight grows scarce.

Worldwide, it strikes about 1 in 20. 2 What differentiates SAD from regular depression is that a full remission occurs in the spring and summer months. 
The fact that SAD occurs when sunlight is at a minimum is not a coincidence.

Your health and mood are intricately tied to exposure to sunlight. 
For example, your serotonin levels (the hormone typically associated with elevating your mood) rise when you?re exposed to bright light.

Your melatonin level also rises and falls (inversely) with light and darkness. 
When it?s dark, your melatonin levels increase, which is why you may feel tired when the sun starts to set (and in the heart of winter, this may be at as early as 4 p.m.).

Scientists generally recommend full-spectrum light therapy over SSRIs like Prozac or Zoloft for this Read Full Article

Then, suddenly, the dark mask just one-shots my team from full health.

That should not be possible. 
Sure, its attack is 42218 while my team's HP is only 41619, but my full-dark resist Akechi wasn't bound so I should have had five percent dark resistance. 
That should have taken its damage down to 40108 - easily survivable from full health. 
Is this the point where I learn that there's some variance to what their actual attack is?

Did you take a picture? 
If one of the leads (you used A Luci too?) was bound your total hp would have been reduced. 
When I beat it the dark mask never attacked me, just kept binding. 
My total hp was 43,565.

Anti-ageing ? lasers

have come to the forefront of anti-ageing beauty treatments in the last few years, and, with stars like Jennifer Aniston having praised the method , we can see the appeal. 
One of the options is a resurfacing treatment. 
This works by the laser removing a layer of skin from the face and causing softer, tighter skin to grow back with less visible blemishes and wrinkles. 
Several treatments are needed for the desired effect.

The other option is photorejuvenation, which works when the laser stimulates the production of collagen in the skin, which ?plumps out? fine lines and wrinkles.

Cutis is the best clinic for anti ageing treatment in bangalore.

"Sleep disturbances are one of the most common symptoms of traumatic brain injury. 
Studies show that up to 65% of individuals suffering from traumatic brain injury have symptoms from sleep disturbances.

Sleep is extremely important as while sleeping the brain refreshes the connections that allow it to function and physically the body including muscles get the rest that is needed.

Some of the side effects of not getting sufficient sleep are:

ú Deepening depression and anxiety;

ú Loss of sense of well-being;

ú Lack of energy;

ú Increased irritability;

ú Increased fatigue;

ú Increased lack of cognition and concentration.

Traumatic brain injury causing sleep disturbances causing the above side effects greatly multiply the symptoms of traumatic brain injury.

Sleep disturbances that can occur following traumatic brain injury are as follows:

ú Insomnia-Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep;

ú Excessive daytime sleepiness and drowsiness;

ú Mixing up sleep patterns;

ú Narcolepsy-Falling asleep uncontrollably during the day.

Traumatic brain injury can cause these sleep disturbances in many ways including:

ú An injured brain may not be able to tell the body to fall asleep or wake up due to chemical changes;

ú Loss of the brain's ability to control breathing causing sleep apnea;

ú Medications taken following the brain injury may cause problems going to sleep or staying asleep;

ú Sleeping during the day and physical inactivity;

ú Pain;

ú Depression.

Ways to improve sleep following traumatic brain injury:

ú Follow a schedule using an alarm to wake up the same time each day;

ú Get enough exercise and physical activity;

ú Avoid excessive napping during the day;

ú Avoid alcohol, nicotine and caffeine;

ú Review medications with your physician;

ú Transcranial light therapy-Studies have shown that light emitting diodes (LED) is a promising tool for neurorehabilitation. 
LED is a painless, non-thermal treatment that helps cellular function of injured brain cells.

"Linked pods of low-level infrared light can be draped over an aching area. 
Physical therapists are increasingly recommending the therapy as an alternative to traditional electric heating pads for relieving aches.

(BioCare)

Physical therapists are increasingly recommending low-level infrared light therapy as an alternative to traditional electric heating pads for relieving muscle aches and tension -- not uncommon side effects of long flights and active days exploring new terrain.

BioCare has introduced a travel-friendly infrared therapy device called LumiWave, which uses four linked-together LED-powered pods that can be draped over an aching area or fastened around a wrist or ankle.

In testing, the heat against the skin felt milder than a heating pad, but did soothe sore muscles, especially after a few treatments. 
LumiWave Infrared Light and Heat Therapy System is $299 for four-pod version; $449 for eight-pod model.

Canadian doctors have managed to reverse severe MS using stem cells, virtually eliminating it from a patient's body. 
Jennifer Molson had crippling MS before she participated in a study that involved chemotherapy and a stem cell bone marrow transplant in 2002. 
Molson was one of a small cohort of 24 people who received the high-risk, experimental therapy.

Led by Dr. Mark Freedman and Dr. Harold Atkins at the Ottawa Hospital, the clinical trial spanned over 13 years.

"Facial Mask 101 And Which One is Right For You

November 3rd, 2015

The entire purpose of skincare is to build or preserve collagen. 
Retinols, organic skincare products, lasers, facials and just about everything you do is for increasing collagen.

It?s difficult to overestimate the importance of collagen when it comes to healthy skin. 
I personally like non-invasive procedures such as facials, a daily skincare routine and the additional things that I do in order to round up my routine.

This can include something as simple as sleep more, exercise to release stress, drink a green juice or one of my favorite activities, do a mask.

In the video below I give you some insights into mask, how to use them, what type is right for your skin and more.

Remember, collagen makes up about a quarter of your body?s total protein content, lending itself to skin, hair, bones, tendons and internal organs. 
In order to build collagen you need the proper nutrition and skincare regime.

Collagen adds structure to the skin, giving it elasticity and plumpness. 
While you can bolster your collagen intake with foods like water-rich veggies, fish and lean meats, you can also turn to a masks to keep your skin looking youthful.

To make your appointments at Joanna Vargas please call 212.949.2350.

Breakthrough Full Body LED Light Therapy

The full body LED light bed was featured in the July 2011 issue of Vogue. 
The bed covers the entire body with red and infrared light, reversing the signs of aging, eliminating cellulite, stretch marks, reducing pores and giving you smoother and more even skin tone

Joanna Vargas' signature microcurrent facial is groundbreaking technology and a celebrity beauty secret. 
This facial is proven to erase wrinkles, firm skin, define your features and it leaves you with dramatic younger looking skin

"Am J Psychiatry. 2006 Dec;163(12):2126-2133.

Controlled Trial of Naturalistic Dawn Simulation and Negative Air Ionization for Seasonal Affective Disorder .

Terman M, Terman JS. Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, and New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr., Unit 50, New York, NY 10032. 
This email address is being protected from spambots. 
You need JavaScript enabled to view it. .

OBJECTIVE: This trial assessed two novel nonpharmaceutical treatments for winter depression-naturalistic dawn simulation and high-density negative air ionization-delivered during the final hours of sleep. 
METHOD: The patients were 99 adults (77 women and 22 men) with the winter seasonal pattern of major depressive disorder (94 cases) and bipolar II disorder (five cases). 
Five parallel groups received 1) dawn simulation (0.0003-250 lux in the pattern of May 5 at 45 degrees north latitude); 2) a dawn light pulse (13 minutes, 250 lux, with an illuminant dose of 3.25x10(3) lux-minutes matched to the simulated dawn); 3) postawakening bright light (30 minutes, 10,000 lux); 4) negative air ionization at high flow rate (93 minutes, 4.5x10(14 )ions/second); or 5) ionization at low flow rate (93 minutes, 1.7x10(11) ions/second). 
The symptoms were assessed over 3 weeks with the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version. 
RESULTS: Posttreatment improvement results were bright light, 57.1%; dawn simulation, 49.5%; dawn pulse, 42.7%; high-density ions, 47.9%; and low-density ions, 22.7% (significantly lower than the others). 
Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, analysis of variance failed to find superiority of dawn simulation to the dawn pulse or bright light. 
However, the dawn pulse led to a pattern of residual or exacerbated depressive symptoms similar to those seen in low-density ion nonresponders. 
CONCLUSIONS: Naturalistic dawn simulation and high-density ionization are active antidepressants that do not require the effort of postawakening bright light therapy. 
They can be considered candidate alternatives to bright light or medication.

"Scientists are currently in South Africa putting together a unique medical imaging platform which could improve treatment for millions of cancer sufferers by making proton therapy a viable option.

Members of the multi-national research team behind the PRaVDA (Proton Radiotherapy Verification and Dosimetry Applications) project, led by the University of Lincoln, UK, are now building the instrument that will produce for the first time detailed three-dimensional images of a patient?s anatomy using protons rather than x-rays.

To produce these Proton CT images, the world-first technology will use the same high energy particles that are used to destroy a tumour during proton therapy treatment.

Like x-rays, protons can penetrate tissue to reach deep tumours. 
However, compared to x-rays, protons cause less damage to healthy tissue in front of the tumour, and no damage at all to healthy tissue lying behind, which greatly reduces the side effects of radiation therapy.

Led by Distinguished Professor of Image Engineering Nigel Allinson MBE, the PRaVDA team aims to become the first in the world to produce clinical-quality Proton CT imagery. 
They are currently working near Cape Town at the South African National Cyclotron ? a type of particle accelerator.

Professor Allinson said: ?Proton therapy is an improved approach for treating challenging tumours especially in the head and neck, and near critical organs. 
It is likely to become the preferred radiotherapy method for most childhood cancers, as the unwanted exposure to radiation of healthy tissue is much reduced and so the risk of second cancers later in life is also much reduced.

?Having the ability to administer a high dose in a small region is the main underlying advantage of proton therapy, however accurate planning is absolutely essential to ensure that the dose does not miss the target tumour.?

Using protons to form an image of the patient will greatly improve the accuracy of proton therapy. 
Using current methods, there could be a discrepancy of up to 1cm in terms of where the proton beam hits and releases its energy, destroying cells, after passing through 20 cm of healthy tissue. 
By using Proton CT, this margin for error can be reduced to just a few millimetres.

The PRaVDA researchers believe that Proton CT will soon be used as part of the planning process for cancer patients, as well as during and after treatment.

?Imaging with protons is challenging, because the individual particles are randomly scattered as they pass through tissue,? Professor Allinson continued. 
?Millions of protons make up a single image and each particle has to be individually tracked from the point it enters the patient to the point where it leaves. 
The PRaVDA instrument is therefore one of the most complex medical instruments ever developed, but it is absolutely essential - the uncertainties in where the protons lose their energy and do damage to either tumour or healthy tissue will only be eliminated by using the same type of radiation to image and to treat.?

Proton therapy is rapidly gaining momentum as a cancer treatment around the world. 
The NHS will open two proton therapy centres in 2018, and up to another four private centres are also planned for the UK.

The PRaVDA consortium, funded by a œ1.6 million translation grant from the Wellcome Trust and led by the University of Lincoln, consists of five UK universities, four UK NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts, University of Cape Town and IThemba LABS, South Africa, and Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.

Interval Debulking Surgery Is Less Invasive Than Upfront Debulking Surgery for Stage III/IV Cancers (ovarian/PP/FT)

medical news

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE

In a phase III trial, the standard treatment (primary debulking surgery) was compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including interval debulking surgery) for patients with stage III/IV ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers. 
Neoadjuvant therapy led to fewer surgeries, reduced operation time, less organ resection, less blood loss, fewer albumin transfusions, and fewer high-grade adverse events following surgery.

Neoadjuvant therapy is less invasive than the standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer and may become the new standard if noninferiority is confirmed.

I used it for 11 days and I have noticed that I am experiencing more hyperpigmentation in my skin.

I was looking for it to help even out my skin tone, but now, my face and neck areas are darker than the rest of my body. 
I need to know if this is normal considering the melanin in my skin. 
Should I stop using the unit completely and use a topical product? 
I just don't know what I should do at this point.

https://youtu.be/inmQCF7tI3w

The A E Skin Soft and Smooth Rejuvenation treatment is a two-step procedure designed by Dr. Alex to address color and texture in a single session.

The first step is a Forever Young BBL IPL photofacial treatment. This step uses bright light to target dark spots and blood in the skin. This works well for sun damage, age spots, broken capillaries, and generalized redness.

The second step is a Micro Laser Peel. This step uses a different laser to remove a thin layer of dead skin cells from the surface. This exfoliates the skin to improve the texture. It also enhances the results of the first step by allowing the pigment to exfoliate faster. It also works well to address acne because it removes the dead skin cells which clog pores.

These are some representative before and after pictures of patients who received the A E Skin Soft and Smooth Rejuvenation treatments. Improvements are seen in terms of color, texture, and tone. Most skin types can be treated and a series of three to six treatments are recommend. Treatments are done every four to eight weeks. After that, maintenance treatments are done once every three to six months.

"European Cosmetic Surgery, Facial Aesthetics and Medical Laser Devices

The total European market for cosmetic surgery , facial aesthetics and medical lasers will approach ?1.18 billion by 2019.This market includes botulinum toxin A, dermal fillers, breast implants, non-breast implants, aesthetic laser and light therapy devices, non-invasive skin tightening devices and non-invasive fat reduction devices.

Some sights from my first trip to Chesterton?s European Market. 
It was full of food, rubber duckies, and my new favorite trail mix. 
Held every Saturday in Chesterton from late May through October, the market attracts musicians,restaurants and artisan food venders from all over the Midwest.

One person that I had the pleasure of meeting yesterday was Apryl Niksch. 
She is the founder of the fabulous Harvest Circle Workshop. 
Her booth featured DIY Trail Mix and the most delicious Protein Balls that I have ever tasted! 
The trail mix bar had really healthy ingredients like soybeans, almonds and unsweetened coconut. 
Which is awesome because I adore trail mix but not all the sugar-laden ingredients that usually are in it. 
It was simply scrumptious. 
And Apryl was super cool-even posing for a picture. 
Thanks Apryl!

In addition to illuminating one's home or office, these lighting examples also work to stabilize one's mood or to cure seasonal affective disorder cases.

While examples like illuminated shades help to boost energy and enthusiasm during winter months when sunlight is scarce, illuminated anti-aging masks work to perfect and brighten dull and weathered skin.

Additional wellness-focused lighting innovations include futuristic light therapy pods that work to relax users along with app-connected light bulbs that can be customized and adjusted according to brightness, color and longevity of light. 
The latter example is ideal for those looking to unwind after a busy day and are a popular product that aids with both meditation and sleep."

HRT for men 'can improve sex lives of the elderly' after new hormone therapy sees increases to low libido

Form of HRT therapy could treat older men with low levels of testosterone

Men who were given hormone became more interest in sex and had more

Whereas participants given a placebo saw no improvement in their sex life

Men treated during 12 month study saw consistent improvement in libido

A male hormone therapy can give elderly men their sex drive back and cure erection problems, a new study found.

Older men with a low libido and depleted testosterone levels can be treated with a male form of HRT therapy to get them once more active between the sheets. 
Men given the hormone became more interest in sex, had more sex and were able to get erections at night.

But those given a placebo saw no improvement in their sex life.

Testosterone is a key male sex hormone involved in maintaining sex drive, erectile function and sperm production.

But as men age levels of the hormone drop. 
The largest study to date in older men was designed to investigate the effectiveness of testosterone therapy.

The trial involved 470 heterosexual men aged of 65 with low testosterone levels and symptoms of testosterone deficiency Dr Glenn Cunningham, of Baylor College of Medicine and Baylor St. Luke's Medical Centre in Houston, Texas, said: 'Our findings indicate low testosterone is one cause contributing to reduced libido and erectile dysfunction in older men. 
'Men experiencing these symptoms should be evaluated for testosterone deficiency.'

During the year-long study, the men received either testosterone gel or a placebo applied to the skin.

They answered questionnaires about their sex life at the start and then ever three months during the 12-month study.

The men treated with testosterone therapy showed consistent improvement in libido and in 10 of the 12 sexual activity measurements, including frequency of intercourse, masturbation and night time erections.

Dr Cunningham added: 'For symptomatic older men with low testosterone levels, testosterone therapy led to consistent improvement in most types of sexual activity.'

The Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline recommends using testosterone therapy to treat men with symptoms of androgen deficiency and low levels of testosterone.

Androgen deficiency occurs when a man has consistently low levels of testosterone and resulting symptoms such as sexual dysfunction.

In the past 15 years, use of testosterone therapy has rapidly expanded among men.

Testosterone levels decline as men age, and some men develop low testosterone levels and symptoms.

Since 2000, the number of men beginning testosterone therapy has almost quadrupled in the US according to a 2014 study published in the same Journal.

Different colors have different shape wave lengths that move at different speeds effecting the body in different ways.  I meet a man probably 16 years ago who spoke to a group  about this. I don't remember the color but my muscle spasms stopped. It's not like you need to shine a light in your face. You could take a flashlight and put green selaphane over it and aim it to your head. I know it sounds right up there with a tinfoil hat but light therapy is legit.

"New York, March 11 : Light therapy -- exposure to artificial light -- can decrease depressive symptoms and normalise circadian rhythms among cancer survivors, finds a study.

""Depressive symptoms are common among cancer survivors' even years after treatment has ended,"" said Heiddis Valdimarsdottir from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, US.

""This interferes with overall quality of life and puts survivors at risk for poor outcomes including death,"" he added.

Most patients face some degree of depression, anxiety, and fear when cancer becomes part of their lives. 
According to the American Cancer Society, one in four people with cancer have clinical depression.

Researchers randomly divided 54 cancer survivors into a bright white light or a dim red light group.

Participants were provided with a light box and asked to use it for 30 minutes every morning for four weeks.

Depressive symptoms and circadian activity rhythms were measured before, during and three months after completing the light exposures to determine the effectiveness of light therapy.

The findings showed that patients exposed to the bright light experienced improvement in depressive symptoms while those exposed to the dim red light experienced no change in symptoms.

""Our findings suggest light therapy, a rather non-invasive therapy, may provide an innovative way to decrease depression among cancer survivors,"" added study co-author William Redd.

The good news is that depression can be treated and bright light therapy is a potentially effective new treatment option, Valdimarsdottir noted while presenting the findings at the American Psychosomatic Society's event in Denver, Colorado."

"Benefits of ?IPL Photofacial Procedure By Docshop Is a 30-minute procedure in which intense pulses of light are used to penetrate deep into the skin. IPL photo rejuvenation then causes collagen and blood vessels below the epidermis to constrict, reducing redness and age lines. The procedure involves only minimal discomfort, while the redness and swelling that sometimes occur after treatment disappear shortly. Most benefits of a photofacial/fotofacial occur gradually in the weeks following treatment. For even greater cosmetic enhancement, patients may also opt for a foto-facial,a procedure that combines radio waves with light waves to achieve excellent results. Say goodbye to the effects of sun damage, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, and more. With the innovative Intense Pulsed Light (IPL?) photofacial/ foto-facial procedure, gentle skin rejuvenation is now easier than ever. IPL photo rejuvenation is the latest in modern dermatology, allowing patients to transform red, blotchy skin into a radiant complexion. If you suffer from any of these problems, photo-facial/foto-facial treatments may be the dermatological approach you've been looking for. An IPL photofacial can be an effective way to eliminate many cosmetic issues, including moderate acne scars and rosacea. When such factors are particularly severe, however, photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be a better option. While this procedure is slightly more invasive than an IPL photo facial, it often provides better treatment for pronounced redness in the face as well as deeper scarring caused by You will amaze if your results!!acne. Like an IPL photofacial, PDT also encourages the production of new collagen, reducing fine lines and improving skin tone. Speaking to a cosmetic dermatologist is the best way to determine if PDT is right for you. Come, schedule your appointment now at RD Laser Skin Solutions, You will amaze if your results!!?

"Hi Holly Cunningham! Thank you so much for your interest in Planet Fitness! We will have 3 mid level lay down tanning beds with the bronzing bulbs and 2 Stand up tanning beds. The Total Body Enhancement combines infrared light with a vibrating platform that can stimulate muscles and provide therapeutic massage. The vibrations can relieve tension, relax muscles, speed metabolism, stimulate circulation, and aid in fighting the outward appearance of cellulite. The red light therapy can increase collagen production from infrared light to create more youthful skin and help smooth skin?s fine lines and wrinkles. The haircuts are just in a select few Planet Fitness facilities and unfortunately we won't  have them here. The Guest Privileges allow you to bring in one person each time you work out. They are able to use all the workout equipment and locker rooms but you would be the only one with access to the Black Card amenities. Hope this helps! Please let us know if you have any other questions."

All involve the immune system's T-Cells, either in an autoimmune response, or as a malignant manifestation of those T-Cells in the skin. 
Treatment can also be the same: topical steroids, light therapy such as Narrow Band UV-B, Psoralen/UV-A, and Extracorporeal Photopheresis. 
It is rarely a clear-cut situation.

Our second-born, also known as Michael, turned 18 today. 
We wouldn?t dare say it?s been a breeze, because he was definitely our challenge. 
The one where if it was going to go wrong, it went wrong? and yet, he still came out amazing!

From about the 5th month of pregnancy I knew something wasn?t right? 
Born two weeks late but induced due to a slowing heart rate, he was literally pulled out by our midwife because his shoulders had become stuck. 
He was already challenging us! 
After delivery though, his little heart came back twice as strong.

He was quiet and strong.

After a couple of weeks with this perfect little bundle, his jaundice set in. 
?Pumpkin? the nurses called him when we headed back to the hospital for the light therapy. 
His bilirubin count was so high they nearly took him in an ambulance. 
That?s when the quiet ended, but the strong didn?t.

For over four years this little man cried. 
Cried like his fingers had been closed in a car door. 
We went to doctor after doctor, all the while being told he was just fine, it was just who he was. 
Four years of no sleep. 
Four years of rashes everywhere. 
Listening to screaming for the majority of the day. 
Four years of having strangers whisper, or tell me straight to my face what a terrible parent I was because of his screaming. 
Four years of not knowing how to fix his hurting.

But when he did stop, if only for an hour or so, he was so happy, and so beautiful.

After four years, we decided to take him to a therapist to see if they could help. 
?Take him to a naturopath if the doctors won?t listen!?, he said.

Best advice ever!

Our son was allergic to several foods ? corn, wheat (gluten) and dairy (casein). 
All of his favorites of course! 
After cutting those out, we were still left with a kid who only knew how to get angry, but could now at least function. 
Four years of therapy to correct the damage that had been done and all the time lost, and some very caring church leaders, coaches, naturopaths, family and friends who stuck it out with us, he was a completely different kid.

Always challenging. 
Always pushing. 
Always trying something new. 
I couldn?t imagine what life would have been like without him, his energy, his mischievous giggle from the other room and the lessons he brought with him. 
Still strong, sometimes quiet. 
Always a challenge.

Scary delivery, jaundice, food allergies, night terrors, stitches, multiple goose-eggs, Poison Ivy, two broken arms, and none of it slowed him down!

Yes, he still has his allergies, albeit less intense now. 
Yes, he manages quite well with them. 
Yes, it?s changed everything in our life, mostly for the better. 
Not so much for out pocket book, but definitely for our bodies. 
And I am thankful for that!

Our computer nerd through and through, he?s graduating high school with a certificate in Computer Technology, and is about to leave home for a new adventure. 
I?m sure however, we?ll see him grocery shopping our pantry and finding his way home for the wash machine. 
This strong willed, energetic, enthusiastic, kid is ready for the world? I hope it?s ready for him because he doesn?t knock down easily!

"Instead of calming my rosacea with  two sessions of Genesis laser it aggravated it making it worse. So my therapist has suggested IPL followed by alternating between Omnilux and infrared light therapy. 
So far so good. My skin has calmed down a lot, back to what my skin was like before starting the Genesis laser.  I'm hoping with the IPL it will reduce the broken capillaries. ?

"Light therapy -- exposure to artificial light -- can decrease depressive symptoms and normalise circadian rhythms among cancer survivors, finds a study.

""Depressive symptoms are common among cancer survivors' even years after treatment has ended,"" said Heiddis Valdimarsdottir from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, US.

""This interferes with overall quality of life and puts survivors at risk for poor outcomes including death,"" he added.

Most patients face some degree of depression, anxiety, and fear when cancer becomes part of their lives. 
According to the American Cancer Society, one in four people with cancer have clinical depression.

Researchers randomly divided 54 cancer survivors into a bright white light or a dim red light group.

Participants were provided with a light box and asked to use it for 30 minutes every morning for four weeks.

Depressive symptoms and circadian activity rhythms were measured before, during and three months after completing the light exposures to determine the effectiveness of light therapy.

The findings showed that patients exposed to the bright light experienced improvement in depressive symptoms while those exposed to the dim red light experienced no change in symptoms.

""Our findings suggest light therapy, a rather non-invasive therapy, may provide an innovative way to decrease depression among cancer survivors,"" added study co-author William Redd.

The good news is that depression can be treated and bright light therapy is a potentially effective new treatment option, Valdimarsdottir noted while presenting the findings at the American Psychosomatic Society's event in Denver, Colorado."

"A trip to the hospital can be a stressful time for some patients, families and visitors. Luckily, Dr. Cynthia Chandler, a volunteer at Medical Center of Lewisville, has the cure ? a four-legged, furry and freckled face Cocker Spaniel named Jesse. 

Dr. Chandler?s passion for animal assisted therapy led her and Jesse to our facility in the fall of 2013. Realizing the healing potential of animals, she helped start the Paws 4 Patients program which has touched the lives of roughly 600 patients, 300 hospital visitors, and more than 2,000 staff members in just two years. 

The health benefits of bonding with ?man?s best friend? are undeniable. Dr. Chandler and Jesse have brought smiles and comfort, laughter and love, healing and nurturance to many within our hospital doors. 

We?re grateful for their dedication to our patients and proud to call them HCA Heroes. Take a look at their story."

The magic is in the ?light?, this is a must for licensed professionals.

RED LED Light Therapy increases the natural stimulation of cell energy and brings long term results for skin treatments. 
Include as another important facial step for serious skin care for aging, mature, sun damage, and sensitive skins.

Blemished and oily skins need a break, our BLUE LED Light has 460nm with 800nm of infra-red to assist troubled skin. 
Very different than high frequency, blue light uses penetrable light to assist in managing over active oily skins."

"Anti aging in bangalore

October 18, 2016

Anti-ageing ? lasers

have come to the forefront of anti-ageing beauty treatments in the last few years, and, with stars like Jennifer Aniston having praised the method , we can see the appeal. 
One of the options is a resurfacing treatment. 
This works by the laser removing a layer of skin from the face and causing softer, tighter skin to grow back with less visible blemishes and wrinkles. 
Several treatments are needed for the desired effect.

The other option is photorejuvenation, which works when the laser stimulates the production of collagen in the skin, which ?plumps out? fine lines and wrinkles.

Cutis is the best clinic for anti ageing treatment in bangalore.

"Hey Lynne- I just posted this above. I have had psoriasis for a decade, and I've done it all: light therapy, topical steroids, changing my diet to avoid gluten and dairy, and the spots persist. The next step my doctor wanted me to take was the immunosuppressant drugs-- a scary step. 

I have seen many many testimonials about a product called plexus: they are  health supplements that target gut health, and there are more and more studies that link poor gut health to autoimmune diseases. 

I wanted to know that I exhausted every option before I tried injectables. So I am trying plexus! If you have any questions, let me know and we can chat. We are in this together, and we all deserve relief."

"New research shows that light therapy may be more effective than Prozac for patients with depression.

Bright light therapy has been traditionally used for people who suffer from circadian rhythm disorders, along with other sleep disorders. 
It has also been used extensively for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), as this type of mood disorder is largely affected by light exposure. 
However, a new study from the University of British Columbia shows that light therapy may be also effective for major depressive syndromes that are non-seasonal in nature.

One hundred and twenty two patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. 
One experimental group received the bright light therapy. 
A second group provided a placebo light device that did not emit full-spectrum lighting. 
The third group received a combination of medication, fluoxetine (20 milligrams per day), and the fourth group included a placebo device and a placebo medication. 
Light therapy consisted of 30 minutes a day of exposure to the full-spectrum light device, plus a fluorescent light box upon waking. 
Following eight weeks of treatment, changes in the light therapy group were more prominent towards improved mood when compared to the treatment groups. 
What was the most remarkable finding was that 43.8 percent of patients in the light therapy group went into remission, versus only 19.4 percent in those receiving fluoxetine. 
This study confirms that there may be more effective alternative to pharmaceutical interventions for some patients with depression.

Psoriasis is usually a skin condition occurring in some people, may be caused by lots of things, which enable it to create general distress in your life. 
This seems to get the main portion of research now, finding out what triggers that increase. 
Different types of light therapy include sunlight (ultraviolet light), UVB phototherapy, Narrowband UVB therapy, Goeckerman therapy, Photochemotherapy or PUVA, Excimer laser and Pulsed dye laser. 
However it could also increase a persons' sensitivity to light which often can have an adverse effect for anyone treating their psoriasis with light therapy. 
There is UVB therapy which could be used as lamps you use at your home or treatment in the dermatologist's office every few days till the lesions heal. 
Wrap the involved area in plastic wrap (not your brain of course) after applying moisturizer leave overnight to boost scaling and redness. 
Psoriasis normally affects bony joints like the knees or elbows.

As a clear case of psoriasis worsens it gets increasingly difficult to handle plaques and scales through topical medications alone, particularly after they appear over a large percentage in the body. 
Psoriasis is definitely an autoimmune disease, unlike eczema, which is often attributed to external causes alone.

Apply an ointment-based moisturizer frequently to damp skin. 
Any style of detox or fasting program should last for approximately 2-72 hrs, some more and several less. 
Mostly psoriasis returns, though in mild form even. 
It is just not clear how vitamin D works in lessening psoriasis symptoms, though the link between vitamin D deficiency and severe psoriasis is strong. 
The problem is the fact psoriasis also sometimes flares up and starts itching and will spread for some other parts with the body such as nape of the neck, or perhaps your ears. 
It can be an urgent task to find a good natural cures for psoriasis should you desire to totally eliminate psoriasis out of your life. 
At a similar time, Omega 3 also assists in shortening enough time for current flare-ups to heal. 
For worse psoriasis, or where non-medicated creams haven't made an improvement for a condition, medicated creams could possibly be prescribed. 
One thing to note is the fact this classification of treatment therapy is topical.

"Jet lag is not fun. 
Known by the medical community as desynchronosis, the condition occurs when you travel rapidly and over long distances along the Earth?s east-west axis in either direction. 
(It doesn?t happen if you travel along the north-south axis.) This is because your body?s circadian rhythms , your internal clock that tells you when it's day and when it's night, take a while to catch up to the new time zone.

The symptoms of jet lag include poor sleep (trouble falling asleep and/or early waking), mental fogginess, fatigue, headaches, irritability, digestion problems and reduced interest in food. 
If you regularly take long-distance flights, many of these symptoms will sound familiar.

But there is hope for bleary-eyed travelers, as scientists are hard at work trying to find a cure for jet lag, or at least something that will mitigate its effects. 
The latest advance comes from the Stanford University School of Medicine where researchers have discovered a new light-based treatment. 
Unlike other light exposure methods, which require sitting in front of bright lights for hours, the new discovery involves quick, bright flashes of light at night, while you sleep .

Jet lag may require a change of three time zones or more to occur. 
(Photo: Vinicius Depizzol /flickr)

It works because the body is more sensitive to light during the nighttime, even through closed eyelids. 
The flashes are enough to fool the brain into thinking it's daytime (this is a kind of ?biological hack,? say the researchers) and adjust its circadian rhythms to a different time zone. 
With 2-millisecond flashes, which look similar to what a camera flash produces, spaced 10 seconds apart during sleep, the onset of sleepiness for study participants was delayed by close to two hours. 
Traditional light therapy, which uses continuous light during the daytime, achieves a delay of the onset of sleepiness of about 36 minutes.

Less is more, in this case

But why are flashes of light at night more effective than continuous light exposure during the day? 
There are two reasons:

?The first is that the cells in the retina that transmit the light information to the circadian system continue to fire for several minutes after the stimulus ? in this case, flashing light ? is no longer there,? said Jamie Zeitzer, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine and the senior author of the study. 
?The second is that the gaps of darkness between the light flashes allow the pigments in the eye that respond to the light to regenerate ? that is, go from an inactive form that cannot respond to light to an active form that is able to respond to light.?

Best of all for weary travelers, the researchers have found that most people can sleep through the flashes just fine, so in theory travelers could get the benefits from this new therapy with little inconvenience.

The study was published in February in the Journal of Clinical Investigation ."

"I think the most important part of this article is towards the end: ""The researchers note that this new approach has not yet cured any mice. They did find that the therapy led to around a 50 percent increase in life expectancy, but it's difficult to anticipate how this would translate to humans. Taken together, the experiments in mice establish a proof-of-principle for using the tools of synthetic biology to engineer 'tumor-targeting' bacteria to deliver therapeutic proteins in vivo."""

The link below suggests that red LED light exposure will speed up the break up of a bruise as well as other wounds. 
An internet search of ""red light therapy"" provides a lot of anecdotal evidence that simple, red LED party lights or brooder-type infrared heat lamps provide the benefits.
