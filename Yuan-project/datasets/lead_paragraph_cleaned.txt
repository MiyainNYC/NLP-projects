Shenzhen governors have fast-tracked the deployment of charging stations, and the city is the only one in China that offered the recently upgraded E6 for sale to retail customers. Also, Shenzhen residents buying electric cars like the E6 are eligible for rebates totaling 120,000 renminbi, or approximately $19,000, Mr. Hidary said.

Hong Kong Regulator Seeks Penalties for I.P.O. Fraud
HONG KONG - Bankers in Hong Kong, the world's biggest market for initial public offerings, could face as much as two years in prison and fines of more than $100,000 if false or misleading information is included in the listing documents filed by companies they bring to market, according to a proposal by a Hong Kong regulator. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission announced the proposed penalties as part of a regulatory overhaul that follows a series of accounting failures, fraud and other corporate scandals here in recent years, mainly involving companies from mainland China.

CHONGQING, China -- Early this year, as a crisis unfolded in the chambers of power here, three men flew into this fog-wreathed riverside metropolis within a day or two of one another. They were members of the inner court of Bo Xilai, the Communist Party aristocrat who ran the city, and they had come to repair a rupture between the strong-willed Mr. Bo and his equally driven police chief. Just days earlier, on Jan. 28, the police chief, Wang Lijun, had pressed Mr. Bo over evidence tying Mr. Bo's wife to the death last fall of a British businessman, prompting Mr. Bo to punch Mr. Wang in the face, Mr. Wang later recounted to others. The three men -- two of them powerful businessmen and the other a former intelligence agent -- had befriended Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang years ago. They knew both to be controlling and impulsive, and their goal was to broker a peace.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department said on Friday that China had made progress in allowing its currency to rise against the dollar and declined to accuse the nation of manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. The department's decision should help avert a trade dispute. But the department said China's currency was still undervalued and must rise further against the dollar.

BEIJING -- Spooked by a sharply slowing economy, China's leaders have begun opening the financial spigots to build still more roads and airports and subsidize consumer purchases, reprising measures that enabled the nation to sail mostly unscathed through the last great global recession. But the leaders are signaling that the latest round of stimulus spending will fall far short of the four trillion renminbi, or $585 billion at the time, that the government poured into the economy in 2008 and 2009. That spurred a torrent of bank lending, part of it for dubious projects that many experts say will wind up having to be written off in coming years.

Joseph Gagnon is worried. Mr. Gagnon, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the Peterson Institute, contends in a new paper that the world's financial imbalances -- such as China's trade surplus and the United States' trade deficit -- will probably return to record levels in coming years. He argues that the imbalances have narrowed recently only because of the recession (which, for example, has reduced American demand for Chinese exports).

Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about China's tentative steps toward making the renminbi a global currency described the trend in its value versus the American dollar incorrectly in some editions. The renminbi, which was trading just below 6.59 to the dollar on Thursday, Feb. 10., was slightly more than 8 to the dollar five years ago-- 20 percent lower than now, not higher.

The strengthening of the renminbi engineered by Beijing may be a tool to battle inflation in an economy that many economists fear could overheat.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, faces a crisis of confidence. He is excoriated on the right for debasing the currency, and blasted on the left for failing to stimulate more than he has. It has gotten so bad that last week Mr. Bernanke, who prefers to discuss monetary policy with erudite professors like himself, submitted to the indignity of a news conference. Among the uninvited was Representative Ron Paul, who is flirting with a presidential run, and who, if he took office in 2013, would like nothing more than to celebrate the Fed's centennial by ... abolishing it. And that got me to thinking: What if there were no Fed? Don't laugh; it has happened before. The United States had a primitive central bank, conceived by Alexander Hamilton, but President James Madison let its charter lapse in 1811. A second such bank became the target of President Andrew Jackson, who viewed it as a ''hydra'' and a ''curse'' upon the nation. Jackson sought to decertify the bank and, in 1836, succeeded. Never mind that the following year, the United States was plunged into a serious financial panic. The curse had been lifted, not to reappear for nearly a century.

Globalization has been kind to Wall Street. The opening of European capital markets to American investment banks quickly led to United States financial domination of the Continent and of a large part of the rest of the world. American private equity firms have been equally successful at capturing the global market. But as they say on Wall Street, past performance is no indication of future results.
Eliminating the United States trade imbalance would create millions of jobs at no cost to the budget.
The Senate will be taking up Chinese currency this coming week. So I though I should offer a brief note about one of the arguments people make against focusing on Chinese currency manipulation -- namely, the claim that China doesn't really compete head to head with US manufacturing, so that a rise in the renminbi wouldn't help.

Since Standard & Poor’s lowered the nation’s bond rating, Treasury bonds have been one of the few investments that have produced good profits.
Re-Shoring
Ugly new term, but apparently the new thing; it refers to companies moving production back to America from China. The fact that such stories are being heard is support for those (including me) demanding action on the renminbi, because they show that there is indeed a margin at which changes in Chinese dollar costs move production back to the United States, and hence that the undervalued renminbi directly costs US jobs, as well as having the indirect effects I've written about recently.

The United States trade deficit widened to a record $726 billion in 2005, the government reported yesterday, adding more fuel to the increasingly partisan debate between advocates of further globalization and those who contend that free trade is causing the loss of too many American manufacturing jobs. Hitting its fourth consecutive annual record, the gap between exports and imports reached almost twice the level of 2001. It was driven by strong consumer demand for foreign goods and soaring energy prices that added tens of billions of dollars to the nation's bill for imported oil. The nation last had a trade surplus, of $12.4 billion, in 1975.

Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said Tuesday that China's rapid economic rise is being accompanied by a ''high concentration of all kinds of acute problems,'' including official corruption by some officials who ''have violated the rights of the people.'' Mr. Wen described the ''land issue'' as the biggest problem facing hundreds of millions of farmers but suggested that government land policy would not change. Instead, he said enforcement of existing policy must be strengthened to protect farmers' rights at a time when illegal land seizures have fueled protests in the countryside.
